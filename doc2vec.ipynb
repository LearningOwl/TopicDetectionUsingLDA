      "Please give your feedback on the list here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The OWASP Internet of Things Top 10 has not been updated since 2014, for a number of reasons. First of which was the fact that we released the new umbrella project that removed focus from the Top 10 format. This, in retrospect, seems to have been a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea was to just make a vulnerability list, and get away from the Top 10 concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it turns out, people like Top 10 lists, and things have changed enough in the last few years that the team has been working this year to update the project for 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what we’ve come up with so far, and I wanted to just talk through some of the philosophy and methodology for this year’s release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Philosophy\n",
      "\n",
      "So the philosophy we worked under was that of simplicity and practicality. We don’t believe the big data approach works as well as people hope it would, i.e., collecting datasets from hundreds of companies, looking at hundreds of thousands of vulnerabilities, and then hoping for the data to somehow speak wisdom to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quality of the project comes from picking great team members who have the most experience, the least bias, and the best attitudes toward the project and collaboration\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of us on the team have been part of the OWASP rodeo for quite some time, and what we’ve learned over the years is that ultimately—no matter how much data you have—you end up relying on the expertise and judgment of the team to create your final product. In the end it’s the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, we wanted to take input from as many sources as possible to avoid missing vulnerabilities, prioritization, that others have captured elsewhere. We basically took it as a philosophy to be the best of what we knew from everywhere in the industry—whether that’s actual vulnerability data or curated standards and guidance from other types of IoT project.\n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of widgets are these?\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing that we deliberately wanted to sidestep was the religious debates around whether to call these things in the Top 10 vulnerabilities, threats, or risks. We solve that by referring to them as things to avoid. Again, practicality over pedantry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who is the audience?\n",
      "\n",
      "The next big consideration from a philosophy standpoint was looking at who this list is meant to serve. The classic three options are developers/manufacturers, enterprises, and consumers. One option we looked at early on was creating a separate list for each. We might still do this as a later step, but having learned our lesson from removing the Top 10 we decided it’s hard enough getting people to focus on a single one—so three would make it at least three times as hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the 2018 IoT Top 10 is a composite list for developers/manufacturers, enterprises, and consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that as a backdrop, here are the source types we ended up using to collect from and start analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of sanitized *Top N* vulnerability lists from major IoT manufacturers. Parsing of a number of relatively recent IoT security standards and projects, such as CSA’s Future-proofing the Connected World, ENISA’s Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, Stanford’s Internet of Things Security Project, NIST’s Draft 8200 Document, and many more. Evaluation of the last few years of IoT vulnerabilities and known compromises to see what’s actually attracting attention and causing damage. Many conversations with our networks of peer security and IoT experts about the list, to get feedback on priority and clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We very quickly saw some key trends from these inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The weak credential issue stuck out as the top issue basically everywhere\n",
      "\n",
      "Listening services was almost universally second in all inputs\n",
      "\n",
      "Privacy kept coming up in every list, project, and conversation\n",
      "\n",
      "These repeated manifestations in projects, standards, and conversations lead to them being weighted heavily in the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prioritization is critical\n",
      "\n",
      "And that brings us to weighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "We saw the project as basically being two phases:\n",
      "\n",
      "Collecting as many inputs as possible to ensure that we weren’t blind to a vector, vulnerability, category, etc. Determining how to rank the issues to do the most good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally the ratings are based on a combination of likelihood and impact, but in general we leaned slightly more on the likelihood factor because the main attack surface for this list is remote. In other words, it might be (and usually is) much worse to have physical access than to have telnet access, but if the device is on the internet then billions of people have telnet access, and we think that matters a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why Lack of Physical Hardening is I8 and not I4 or I5, for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "So our weighting was ultimately a combination of probability and impact, but with a significant mind towards how common an issue was, how available that issue usually is to attackers, and how often it’s actually being used and seen in the wild. We used our vulnerability lists from vendors to influence this quite a bit, seeing that as a signal that those issues are actually being found in real products.\n",

It’s a unified list for manufacturers/developers, enterprises, and consumers. Our methodology was to go extremely broad on collection of inputs, including tons of IoT vulnerabilities, IoT projects, input from the team members, and input from fellow professionals in our networks. We combined probability with impact, but slightly favored probability due to the remote nature of IoT. We need your help in improving the draft before we go live sometime in October.

      "Cunning malware VPNFilter remains under active development, and is acquiring ever more dangerous features.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the conclusion Cisco's Talos Intelligence security team reached after delving into recent samples and identifying seven “third-stage VPNFilter modules that add significant functionality to the malware”.\n",
      "\n",
      "VPNFilter rose to prominence in May, when Talos found half a million pwned home routers and NAS boxes in 54 countries. The FBI attributed the attacks to Russia's Sofacy group (“Fancy Bear”), seized a command-and-control domain, and asked people to reboot their routers.\n",
      "\n",
      "While maintaining that VPNFilter has mostly been neutralised, Talos' Edmund Brumaghin wrote that “it can still be difficult to detect in the wild if any devices remain unpatched”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The infosec company has stayed on the case, and this Wednesday released a blog post saying the new functions it has discovered include an “expanded ability” to attack endpoints from compromised network devices, data filtering, “multiple encrypted tunnelling capabilities” to conceal C&C and data exfiltration traffic, and a tool to build a network of proxies to conceal the true source of VPNFilter traffic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The specific modules are called:\n",
      "\n",
      "htpx – HTTP traffic redirection and traffic inspection;\n",
      "\n",
      "– HTTP traffic redirection and traffic inspection; ndbr – a multi-functional SSH utility;\n",

      "– Sets up a SOCKS5 proxy on the compromised device; and tcpvpn – Sets up a reverse-TCP VPN on the compromised device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other important discovery Talos highlighted in the post was the attackers' use of a MikroTik administration utility called Winbox, a small Windows 32 utility that mirrors the functions offered on the Web-based admin interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "It turned out older versions of Winbox presented an attack vector through TCP Port 8291, and because Winbox data is passed as “large blobs of binary data,” exploits aren't easily identifiable in network traffic. By way of example, Brumaghin cited early September's directory traversal bug, CVE-2018-14847.\n",

      "“Active Measures” could hardly be more perfectly timed. It’s a documentary that digs into the relationship between Donald Trump and the powers of Russia, and while it’s not as if the film comes up with some smoking gun that Robert Mueller hasn’t yet, it fills in the Trump-Russia connection in a dogged, rigorously reported, eyebrow-raising way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie is a follow-the-money exposé, and the director, Jack Bryan, lays out the roadmap of cash by making bracing and detailed connections between all the forces at work: the snaky leader-thug Vladimir Putin; the oligarchs he placed under his thumb (except for those who wouldn’t cooperate — he got rid of them); the Russian mobsters who are enmeshed in the workings of the Putin government; and Trump himself. “Active measures” is a phrase used in Russia to describe political warfare by the security services to influence the course of world events, but the movie says that if you want to understand the collusion between Trump and Russia, don’t focus on the 2016 election. The collusion goes back decades, and that’s its real meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flush with the likes of John McCain, Hillary Clinton, and John Dean (even the liberal faithful may be surprised at how galvanizing it is to hear Clinton’s insights), the movie kicks off with a fascinating portrait of Putin’s rise to power, complete with some great early photographs of him in which he looks like Illya Kuryakin crossed with Alex from “A Clockwork Orange.” (The glare is killer.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But we already know about Putin — the former head of the FSB, elected to the presidency in the wake of the 1999 terrorist bombing of four Russian apartment buildings that many believe to have been an inside job. (The explosives were of a kind used exclusively by the KGB.) Once Putin assumed power, government critics, including a number of the country’s top journalists, began to turn up dead, and it’s no surprise to hear about Putin’s links with organized crime. But to the extent that “Active Measures” focuses on a kind of Russian mob mentality, it is not, primarily, about murder or the destruction of free speech. It’s about money laundering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia’s preeminent crime boss, a human grizzly bear named Semion Mogilevich, is said to be worth $10 billion, and he was the first Russian to figure out how to launder money on a mass scale. That meant interfacing with the West. Trump Tower, which opened in 1983, was one of the first buildings in New York where shell companies could buy and sell condos without identifying themselves, and it became what Craig Unger of Vanity Fair, in the movie, calls “a money-laundering paradise.” Russian mobsters, such as David Bogatin, began to deal with Trump the year after Trump Tower opened. A little later, the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City was supposed to become Trump’s flagship, but it was a famous debacle that left him in ruins. Apart from its failure as a business, it was charged with violating money-laundering statutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump, famously, was up to his eyeballs in debt, and since he’d filed for bankruptcy half a dozen times, American banks wanted nothing to do with him. All those loans had been his financial Viagra; now they’d dried up. But that’s what made him the perfect mark for the Russians. According to the movie, Trump would never have found his way back had it not been for the flow of cash from the Russian underworld.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are now 30 Trump Towers all over the world, and added together, they contain thousands of condominiums owned by shell companies. According to Unger, a $5 million condo could change hands three or four times a year and — voilà! — you’ve laundered $20 million. That, in essence, is Trump’s business. Not to mention characters like the Russian oligarch Dimitry Rybolovlev, who bought a property from Trump for $95 million, not long after the 2008 real-estate crash, and never pretended to use it. It was a favor — a way of infusing cash into Trump’s pockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is all part of the financial scuttlebutt that has followed Trump around for years, but “Active Measures” names the names and fills in the flowchart of Trump’s corruption with gripping authority. Of course, none of this proves that Trump colluded with Russia in any political sense. But coming just days after the conviction of Paul Manafort, it’s edifying, in “Active Measures,” to get a close-up portrait of how Manafort became the lackey of Putin’s Ukrainian puppet president Viktor Yanukovych. He also went to work for Dimitry Firtash, a Ukranian oligarch who was in bed with the Mob (together, Firtish and his criminal connections siphoned off billions of dollars of gas money), as well as a direct associate of Putin’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Active Measures” cites a key proposition of the Christopher Steele dossier: that the Russians basically turned Donald Trump five years ago. The movie can’t prove this, but it provides a juicy piece of circumstantial evidence when it shows us that Trump, partying in Moscow during the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant (the time when the pee-pee tape, if it exists, was made), left the city after just two-and-a-half days to attend Billy Graham’s 95th birthday bash. Trump’s presidential aspiration was all over that move. (God knows, it wasn’t as good a party.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of “Active Measures” is devoted to filling in Russia’s fake-news propaganda efforts (something it does a thorough job of, though not nearly as deep a one as that found in the chilling, yet-to-be-released documentary “Our New President”), and to the Manchurian Blowhard conjecture that many of us now indulge in on a daily basis, based on the following facts: that Trump, in pushing for the breakup of NATO, has openly pimped for one of the cornerstones of Putin’s wreck-the-West strategy; that at the Republican Convention, language supporting the independence of Ukraine was excised from the party platform at Trump’s request (something that still shocks John McCain); and, of course, the outrageous daily evidence of Trump’s clear and persistent man-crush on Putin. Arriving on the heels of this week’s verdicts, “Active Measures” plays as a heady warm-up to whatever’s coming next. We don’t have the big picture — yet — but this movie does an expert job of connecting more than a few of the dots.\n",

      "Thompson finished with two points and seven rebounds while the Cavs fell to 3-5 with the loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Injuries have never been much of a concern for Thompson, who had played in a franchise-record 447 consecutive games before a sprained thumb kept him out of a couple of games last season. He still ended up appearing in 78 regular-season games last year, plus 18 in the playoffs.\n",

      "\n",
      "As Philly Voice's Kyle Neubeck first reported Tuesday—and the team later confirmed—the Sixers didn't pick up Okafor's fourth-year option for 2018-19. The big man will instead hit unrestricted free agency in July.\n",
      "\n",
      "This news comes on the heels of league sources telling ESPN.com's Chris Haynes that Okafor's camp was \"collaborating\" with Philadelphia to find a \"suitable trade\" for the 21-year-old. The Sixers' decision to decline his option infers a freezing-cold market while nodding to their interest in a summer spending spree.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Multiple members of the organization insisted privately that cap flexibility next summer is a major priority for the team, and they are hopeful they can bring max-level players to the negotiation table,\" Neubeck wrote. \"With Joel Embiid's big raise set to kick in next summer and Robert Covington likely on the verge of signing an extension, Bryan Colangelo and his staff need to find ways to free up money elsewhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Cutting the cord with Okafor after this season trims $6.3 million from the Sixers' bottom line if they let him come off the books. They also could still deal him prior to February's trade deadline, according to ESPN.com's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following hypothetical trades will reflect the Sixers' wide scope of options. They range from pure dumps to \"at least they got something\" to \"Hey! That's not terrible!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain deals will lean into their cap conservation. Others will involve them taking on additional salary. Latter scenarios will not require them to bow out of the free-agency ring entirely, but the Sixers cannot expect to move Okafor while saving money at every turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judging from the decision to decline his option, Okafor's value holds firm at zero-zilch-nada. His appeal dips even further knowing any team that trades for him won't be able to offer him a starting salary in free agency worth more than the $6.3 million he was initially owed next year, per ESPN.com's Bobby Marks.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Sixers are unwilling to add any salary whatsoever, they might as well broker a buyout—which Okafor may push for, according to Marc Stein of the New York Times—or wait for his salary to slither off their books in July.\n",

      "\n",
      "They had one more scrimmage to complete, after which they would head back to Philadelphia feeling energized for their first preseason game on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",

      "Not again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve all been hit in the stomach and you lose your wind,” Brett Brown said following practice on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sixers are continuing to gather medical information on Simmons’ injury. On Saturday, a league source told CSNPhilly.com Simmons will have surgery and a date has yet to be set. President of basketball operations Bryan Colangelo said Sunday that surgery is “likely.” He did not specify the type of fracture (see story).\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t want to get into specific definitions not having the medical expertise,” Colangelo said. “I’ve heard a lot of opinion over the last several days. I’d suffice it to say he broke his fifth metatarsal and how that’s termed or coined I’ll leave for the experts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sixers had been through this before. Joel Embiid missed the last two years with foot injuries. Jahlil Okafor is coming back from season-ending knee surgery. Nerlens Noel sat out his entire rookie season with an ACL injury. The news of Simmons’ injury was all too familiar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is nobody, sadly, that’s had more experience dealing with injured draft picks than we have.” Brown said. “Over the course of time, you learn how to best deal with it. I have seen this every year I’ve been here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At the conclusion of camp, Brown met with Simmons at the hospital where they discussed the news, which Brown described as “deflating.” He believes Simmons’ ability to respond to challenges at a high level and the experience the Sixers staff has rehabbing players from injuries gave Simmons cause for optimism in his recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s a quiet man; his dad was the same,” Brown said. “He’s prideful, he wants to please. … His mood was somber but I think he got a lot excitement about sharing positive stories and truly tapping into what he has available to get him back on the court.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The injury struck a chord with Embiid, whose NBA debut has been on hold since the 2014 Draft. He plans to be a go-to for Simmons if he has questions or needs encouragement during the recovery process.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Obviously I felt for him,” Embiid said. “Immediately I had to talk to him and try to tell him everything is going to be ok, he has to keep his head up. … It’s all about patience and doing the right thing. You’ve got to do what you’re supposed to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sixers had spent less than a week with Simmons, but it quickly became clear how much of an impact he could make on the team. Brown raved about his defensive potential. Simmons’ versatility provides numerous combinations and opportunities for roster experimentation. It was easy to envision how Simmons could become a centerpiece of the team.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I saw the injury, I didn’t believe it would be something like that,” Dario Saric said. “I sent Ben a message, stay positive. I know it’s hard for all of us. He’s one of the leaders of the team.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The team also sensed Simmons’ excitement to begin his NBA career. While he is not overly expressive through his words, his enthusiasm came through on the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was saddened, disappointed for him,” Okafor said. “I know how badly he wanted to bring some joy to the city of Philadelphia and how badly he wanted to go out there and perform. It was unfortunate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sixers are going to take a cautious approach to Simmons’ rehab (see story). And so the team will move forward without him for now, the same way they have done so without their rookies in the past. Brown knows the mindset the players will have to take as they begin their season without one of their top teammates.\n",

      "The plan involved a covert political operative who worked with Putin, a double amputee, a settlement with Texas A&M, and—ultimately—a failed bid that opened up the opportunity for Donald Trump's presidential run.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Donald Trump finds new ways to drag out his vicious feud with the National Football League— he tweeted Monday morning that there's \"no leadership in the NFL\"—a big question looms about where this all began. Could it be, as several reports now suggest, that this whole national trauma can be traced back to Trump's failed attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills back in 2014?\n",
      "\n",
      "That's what some team owners have reportedly said, contending that the president is driven by a personal grudge stemming from his multiple doomed efforts over the decades to become the owner of an NFL franchise. Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan told USA Today that Trump is \"jealous\" of the league and its owners, having failed to become one. \"He's been elected President, where maybe a great goal he had in life—to own an NFL team—is not very likely,\" Khan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, come on, how badly did Trump really want to buy the Bills? Badly enough, it seems, to create a dubious grassroots campaign to pressure the team and the league to not sell to a rival group of bidders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in early 2014, with the team for sale and potential buyers in the process of being narrowed to three finalists—Trump, Buffalo Sabres owner Terry Pegula, and a group of Toronto investors led by Jon Bon Jovi—speculation was rampant that the would-be Canadian buyers planned to move the franchise north of the border. That's when a local fan group sprang up, hoping to turn sentiment in Buffalo against Bon Jovi and his partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "These activist Bills backers called themselves \"12th Man Thunder\" and began orchestrating colorful stunts like establishing \"Bon Jovi-Free Zones\" in local bars, antics that earned them ink everywhere from Breitbart to New York magazine. (All that attention also got them into a legal showdown with Texas A&M over the use of the phrase \"12th man,\" which the Aggies had trademarked.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But what almost nobody knew—until now—is that the whole thing was pulled together by the then-future president of the United States. In the spring of 2014, Trump hired veteran Republican operative and Buffalo resident Michael Caputo—a close associate of Paul Manafort and Roger Stone. Caputo had worked with Ollie North during the Reagan years and then helped boost the careers of Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin as a political consultant in Russia—now he was enlisted to create a group that would scuttle Bon Jovi's NFL chances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trump knew he couldn't outbid the Canadians,\" Caputo recounted to me recently. Instead, Caputo explained, he would scare them off by turning Buffalo against them. Two days after we spoke, the president took the stage at a political rally in Alabama and began his smoldering feud with the NFL by calling any player who showed the temerity to kneel during the national anthem a \"son of a bitch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Having been publicly involved with abortive efforts to launch Trump into New York's gubernatorial race the year before, Caputo was too closely associated with the mogul to be the public face of the 2014 effort, so he recruited others. \"I had it all set up with neighborhood guys who lived by the stadium,\" he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We weren't even allowed to mention [Trump's] name because of the agreement that he signed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a stroke of cunning, Caputo recruited Chuck Sonntag, a double amputee cancer survivor, to serve as the group's leader. Press coverage would occasionally identify Caputo as a \"PR consultant\" to the group, while reporting that it was founded by Sonntag as he lay recovering from his amputations in a rehabilitation center. \"It was easier for Sonntag to lose his leg than his team,\" Caputo recalled.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Astroturfing like this—covertly funding a supposedly grassroots group—was not a new tactic for Trump and his operatives. Back in 2000, Stone and Trump's Atlantic City casino business paid massive fines after they funneled $150,000 to a group called \"the Institute for Law and Society\" to run newspaper ads opposing the legalization of a Native American casino in the Catskills and failed to disclose the transaction to New York's lobbying regulators.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump's involvement in the Buffalo scheme was short-lived. According to Caputo, not long after 12th Man Thunder was formed, Trump entered a $1 billion bid for the Bills, and as a condition of that offer, was forbidden from participating in public outreach efforts related to the sale. So, as Caputo recalls, Trump called him and told him that he had to break off contact with him and the fan group. \"I can't talk to you anymore because of the NDA I signed,\" Caputo remembers Trump saying. \"Have a good time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We immediately made it far more aggressive and anti-Toronto than the president ever envisioned, mostly because we didn't have to worry about getting him crossways with the NFL,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlie Pellien, a Buffalo local who co-founded the group said that keeping a lid on Trump's involvement was a challenge. \"It was all behind the scenes and we weren't even allowed to mention his name because of the agreement that he signed,\" Pellien told me. \"I was bursting at the seams to tell people, 'Hey, this was Donald Trump's idea.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With Trump having removed himself from the picture, Caputo took the gloves off. \"We immediately made it far more aggressive and anti-Toronto than the president ever envisioned, mostly because we didn't have to worry about getting him crossways with the NFL,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The group gathered thousands of signatures for a petition demanding the team remain in Buffalo and started a \"Ban Bon Jovi\" movement to rid upstate New York of the New Jersey rocker's music. A local radio station, Jack FM, started playing a version of \"Livin' on a Prayer\" with new lyrics that went, \"Johnny used to get played on Jack / Now he wants our Bills / But Buffalo just won't take that / He's wack.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It generated so much noise and color that Texas A&M, which has trademarked the phrase \"12th man\" took notice and sent a cease-and-desist letter to the group over its use of the phrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unbowed, Caputo generated a raft of coverage of the dispute that amounted to: Texas A&M threatens double amputee cancer survivor with lawsuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conflict caught the notice of Keith Olbermann, who in July of that year dubbed the university's then-president, Dr. Mark A. Hussey, \"The World's Worst Person in Sports\" for taking on Sonntag. \"Screw you!\" Olbermann declared in a segment about the controversy on his eponymous ESPN show. (Olbermann is now GQ's Special Correspondent and host of \"The Resistance\")\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It changed everything,\" said Caputo, recalling that immediately after the school landed in Olbermann's crosshairs, he received a call from one of its attorneys looking to broker peace. Feeling emboldened, Caputo said he wouldn't settle with the university unless they gave money to his group, to help them keep the Bills in Buffalo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The beating continues unless they donate 25k to this organization to stop the Canadians from buying our team,\" Caputo said he told the university's attorney. Caputo said the school quickly okayed the sum and that he now wishes he had demanded $50,000 for the group. On July 30, the school and the group announced they had reached a settlement and that the group would change its name to \"Bills Fan Thunder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Representatives for the NFL and the White House did not offer comment for this story. A spokesman for Texas A&M declined to comment and instead referred me to a joint press release from the time that describes the settlement as \"amicable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With the threat of legal action out of the way, the group's campaign continued—and it worked, partially. Bon Jovi didn't get the Bills, but neither did Trump. Instead, in September 2014 the team went to Pegula, who has kept it in Buffalo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without an NFL team to run, Trump entered the presidential race nine months later, capitalizing on anti-foreigner sentiment, outrageous stunts and the enthusiasm of colorful grassroots groups to win the presidency. Caputo, Stone and Manafort each joined his presidential campaign as advisers and then left it amid various public blowups. All three have been hauled before Congress as it investigates possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caputo said Bills Fan Thunder still exists, and that it now has 20 season tickets it uses to send underprivileged youth from Buffalo, along with chaperones, to each home game. Caputo told me that after Trump launched his White House bid, he informed the candidate that the group had transformed into a vehicle for taking poor kids to Bills games. Trump, he said, seemed pleased and regularly peppered him for updates on the organization over the course of the campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Olbermann, meanwhile, has just published a book based on his GQ work critiquing the president—it is called, unsubtly, \"Donald Trump is F*cking Crazy.\" Despite their differences, Caputo places the imperatives of football over mere political disagreements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He can do whatever he wants on GQ and say whatever he wants,\" Caputo said of Olbermann. \"He'll always be a hero to me.\"\n",

There are streaks and records and head-to-head matchups and end-of-season accolades. The data, the video clips, the testimonials—it's all there to compare across time. The games don't change as much as other things in society change, and so we can make strong cases, we can make cross-generational arguments, we can say things like: LeBron James is the greatest living athlete. Based on what he's done on the court thus far and what he still could potentially do in years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, an athlete's greatness can be defined more expansively. What was their influence? What did they mean? It's almost like the difference between a strict and a broad constructionist. The former looks at only what's there and says, for example: He was a top-three running back based on rushing yards and touchdowns. The latter looks at the expansiveness of the role an athlete plays in their society at a given time and asks: Who were they compared to? Who could they and should they have been? What did they do for their generation? What power did they wield, and to what effect?\n",
      "\n",
      "LeBron James is, we'd argue, a broad constructionist on the athlete-greatness front. There is LeBron James the basketball player, and he's front and center, he's still number one. But there's a deep understanding of the way this life of his is going to work for decades to come—that one day (maybe not as soon as for some other players, but still) basketball will run out, and it will be on to Phase II. Which is why he spends his off-season cramming his days laying groundwork for what comes next, expanding the universe of LeBron Inc.\n",

      "Over the course of a couple of weeks, I was with him as he premiered a documentary with Drake at the Toronto Film Festival, addressed crème de la crème world leaders in Midtown Manhattan, walked in a fashion show in Hell's Kitchen, and soldiered through a five-hour magazine photo shoot with ninja-military precision in L.A. (He didn't request a single thing during the shoot, not water, not food; he had one fruit snack that I offered him from my pack. It was grape.) I watched up close the ways he transformed expertly from audience to audience, modulating his clothes, and his voice, and his posture, and the way he used his hands (sometimes gesturing wildly, sometimes holding them quietly in a diamond shape at his belt buckle), and even the way he talked about the game he's galactically famous for. (I watched him oversimplify basketball to a roomful of film producers, who he safely assumed might be basketball illiterate, even describing a slam dunk as \"one of our best plays in my sport.\") He code-switched effortlessly, all depending on who was sitting across the proverbial business table from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's deadly serious about his universe of extra-basketball enterprises. And that fact right there is just one of the several arguments for his greatness. He knows the critical importance of Phase II for taking the fame, the exposure, and the influence that he has garnered and cultivated in basketball, and amplifying it to any number of ends. He knows that LeBron without Phase II is…Wilt? Russell? That is, a legacy of greatness on the court for all time, but muted by a relatively quiet life after the game. A quiet life after the game is not for LeBron James.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is why, over the years, he's spent such energy and shrewdness assembling the people around him—a Dream Team of old friends and new partners and experts in this field and that, who strategically operate within every emerging arena for him. The team is critical. The team will go a long way to priming the potential greatness of LeBron James in Phase II.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have people around me, for the most part, that've been around me for a long time,\" he told me. \"So when you've been around people for a long time, there's no sugarcoating, there's no trying to put you higher than what you should be, there's no yes-men or -women, there's no gas. It's just straight-up, raw, uncut, unfiltered knowledge, truth, passion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter how grand an athlete's ambitions outside the arena, their influence is limited if they're not exceptionally dominant in it. Despite the best ideas or the most benevolent intentions, their potential influence correlates with their talent. It just does. They can't do what LeBron James wants to do in the world if they haven't already made their case on the court. Which is, of course, why the greatness of this athlete in particular obviously starts there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite LeBron's having won just—\"just\"—four MVP awards, no player has been more consistently dominant and impactful over the past decade and a half in the NBA. And yet it's hard to see when the downturn will come. Somehow at 32 and on the verge of Season 15, he's in better shape than he was during his rookie year. (\"I feel amazing,\" he told me while getting a hand massage.) Veteran LeBron has double the muscle and seemingly none of the body fat of Rookie LeBron. He looks like an action figure—an unrealistic one at that. But you don't charge up and down the court like a freight train, guarded by every team's best and most physical defender game in and game out, 39 minutes a night, without showing a little wear and tear somewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as I could tell, he has only two physical tells that confirm his mortality. The first? His feet. Every ballplayer has busted-up, twisted feet. But the King's are exceptionally wrung out. They look like they went 12 rounds with the bear from The Revenant.\n",

It's a fact that is key to unlocking the whole recipe—the unmatched talent, yes; the unfettered intensity, sure; but more than anything, that physical consistency, the ability to just play, to stay in the game. The most high-profile player in sports can have his head busted open—during the NBA Finals, no less—and he keeps it a secret because glue will be sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to on-court greatness, LeBron beats MJ—and every other athlete—for these factors and more, and because he has the legitimate potential to play the game of basketball at the highest level longer than anyone else. Or, as he put it when I asked how he thought he could become greater than MJ in most people's eyes: \"If I was the most consistent and was at the top of the food chain more than anybody in NBA history.\" He's been to seven straight NBA Finals and could seemingly play at that level for another 10 seasons—25 total. That's astonishing. And no one has been \"the greatest\" for decades.\n",

      "The Four Seasons conference room in New York was filled with producers, cameramen, and the obligatory anxiety that comes with waiting to receive a very famous person. There were basically two guys in charge in the room, one in a decent suit and one in a bad suit. Bad Suit worked for the Bloomberg Global Business Forum and explained what LeBron James was doing there: They needed \"a world leader of equal stature\" to the attendees of their upcoming summit—statesmen and businessmen like Emmanuel Macron, Justin Trudeau, Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Tim Cook, and Jack Ma (Asia's richest man). It was one of those highly exclusive gatherings where all the world's problems would either be solved or spawned. In the conference room, there were ten or so people setting up to record the greeting, a pre-taped call to action to be broadcast at the opening of the summit. \"How many world leaders are actually known around the world?\" Bad Suit said. \"We needed him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When LeBron enters a room, it feels like the floor tilts down in his direction. And this afternoon was no different. His voice carried. His hand, extraterrestrial, extended with seasoned celebrity coyness. Our necks craned up. The King smiled down, a smile as wide as his wingspan. His Lanvin shirt looked painted on. He had a pair of Nike Air Zoom Generation sneakers on his feet. He was about to address the leaders of the Free World in a pair of Nikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decent Suit ushered LeBron to his seat in front of a teleprompter and gave him directions he didn't need. \"You're representing all of us,\" he said. Meaning: people who want more from their elected and unelected leaders. LeBron politely insisted, \"I got it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After the prompter scrolled the speech a few times, LeBron gave it—a speech he was seemingly reading for the first time—a try and nailed it on the first attempt. He never hesitated or second-guessed a single word. Bad Suit's eyes filled with the same hope Morpheus's did when he found out that Neo was in fact the One. Someone in the back gasped, like out of a movie. And then, to just about every head of state and titan of industry worth a damn, 32-year-old LeBron James said, \"We know the world needs us to step up.\"\n",

      "A moment like that is the most significant reason why LeBron James is the greatest living athlete. Greatness has an all-encompassing burden. It's a beauty and brains type of mandate. Floyd Mayweather could go undefeated for 50 more fights, but he'd never be the greatest living athlete. Because he's selfish. And tacky. And consequently, small. You have to transcend sport to be the greatest—beyond sneakers and drinks that replenish electrolytes and video-game covers and money teams.\n",

To be able to legitimately have an effect on the way people live in the world, as corny as it sounds. And LeBron, more than any other living athlete on earth, has that in him. The fact that he's putting over a thousand kids through college is commendable. But when assessing his imprint and the potential of his reach, it seems relatively small. Like a 30-point game. He's reaching for something bigger. Something that most athletes eschew and that LeBron himself wasn't always inclined to do. It's not like he was out there his rookie season stumping for candidates. But things have changed. It's a different world now. Which is why I figured I'd test out the upper limit of his ambition.\n",

And I don't give a damn what you talking about. I love him.' So they don't have a choice liking me. But at the end of the day, these people are gonna resort back to who they are. So do I have a definite answer to that? My state definitely voted for Donald Trump, the state that I grew up in. And I think I can sit here and say that I have a lot of fans in that state, too. It's unfortunate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The way LeBron speaks on race threads a very fine needle. It's healing and inclusive while also being extremely real. He's the anti-conformist athlete. From tweets and Instagram posts about police brutality to the way he's taken control of his career—off the court and on the court. The way he chose to leave Cleveland and then chose to come back. The way he broke the norms of free agency in the process. He's liberated every NBA player from now to eternity. But at the time, in the summer of 2010, he was bludgeoned for it—by media, by fans, and, perhaps most controversially, by Cavs owner Dan Gilbert, who published an open letter to the city of Cleveland, effectively calling LeBron a narcissist and a traitor. It had nothing to do with business or sport, for that matter. Some argued that it read like he thought he owned more than just the team—like he owned LeBron.\n",

Unfortunately, I felt like, at that point in time, as an organization, we could not bring in enough talent to help us get to what my vision was. A lot of people say they want to win, but they really don't know how hard it takes, or a lot of people don't have the vision. So, you know, I don't really like to go back on that letter, but it pops in my head a few times here, a few times there. I mean, it's just human nature. I think that had a lot to do with race at that time, too, and that was another opportunity for me to kind of just sit back and say, 'Okay, well, how can we get better? How can we get better? How can I get better?' And if it happens again, then you're able to have an even more positive outlook on it. It wasn't the notion of I wanted to do it my way. It was the notion of I'm gonna play this game, and I'm gonna prepare myself so damn hard that when I decide to do something off the court, I want to be able to do it because I've paid my dues.\"\n",
