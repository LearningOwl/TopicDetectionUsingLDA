# Topic Detection using Supervised and Unsupervised learning methods.

In this project, we build datasets potentially tailored to our model needs.

These 2 repos are as follows.
Chromatic News Newsletter Archive Downloader, Mica Eldridge
https://github.com/mica5/chromatic_news/tree/master/download_newsletter_archives

One Week of Global News Feeds data downloader, Jayant Shelke
https://github.com/LearningOwl/ArticleDownloaderAndParser

The datasets prepared from these 2 repos are then utilized by Jupiter notebooks for creating and training the models.
WE use 2 learning techniques.
- Supervised
  - SVM
- Unsupervised
  - LDA and doc2vec
  
This project aims at understanding the behaviour of making supervised and unsupervised model work together and check of quality of results.

The project results were satisfactory and results in a good accuracy for topic detection.

For more details, Please check the PDF and slides of this project uploaded in the repo.
