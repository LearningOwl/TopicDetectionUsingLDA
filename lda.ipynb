      "More than 80,000 people in the US died from the flu last winter during what was a particularly nasty influenza season, the federal government estimated. It was the highest number reported in at least 40 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson confirmed the estimated death toll, first reported by the Associated Press, to BuzzFeed News Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was a really tough flu year,\" Colin Bucks, an emergency medicine physician at Stanford Health Care, told BuzzFeed News. \"It’s frustrating because it's preventable. It's stuff we prepare for every year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to last winter, the CDC estimates that since 2010, there have been between 140,000 and 710,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 12,000 to 56,000 flu-related deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Last winter's flu season started early, with a large number of cases occurring around the holidays, and struck infants and the elderly particularly hard. Activity continued to increase throughout January and remained high through the end of March.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outbreak included a mixture of three strains: H3N2, H1N1, and influenza B. The flu vaccine was not as effective against the H3N2 strain, the predominant strain, due to a genetic mismatch between the vaccine version of the virus and its wild form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bucks said there's always the potential for the virus to cause a higher than normal number of deaths and that the best way to prevent infection regardless is to get vaccinated regardless of how effective the vaccine is that year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Particularly if you're older, if you've got children, if you're pregnant, it's really important to get vaccinated,\" Bucks said. \"If you start to get sick stay home.\"\n",

      "Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk has settled a lawsuit filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Though he admitted no wrong-doing, the billionaire agreed to pay a $20 million fine and step down as the company’s chairman for a three-year period for using his personal Twitter account to announce he had the funding secured to take Tesla private. The California-based automaker also agreed to make leadership reforms and pay a $20 million fine for not vetting the information Musk writes on Twitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The executive posted what could go down in history as the world’s most expensive tweet on August 7, 2018. The possibility of taking Tesla private at $420 a share turned the stock market on its head and immediately captured the attention of the SEC. The fraud charges brought against Musk on September 27 argued his tweet was unfounded — Tesla didn’t have the funding secured to go private at the time the statement was made — and pointed out the false information hurt investors by causing significant market disruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the most significant part of the settlement, the SEC ordered Musk to step down as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors within 45 days. He will be replaced by an independent chairman appointed by the board; it’s too early to say who will fill that role. Musk will be allowed to run for chairman again in 2021, though the SEC holds the power to extend the length of the ban if it sees fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla will also need to appoint two new independent directors to its board, and the SEC wants it to establish a new committee of independent directors. The $40 million fine collected from Musk and Tesla will be distributed to harmed investors under a court-approved process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, Twitter found itself near the center of the investigation. The SEC focused on how Musk has leveraged the platform to communicate with his 22.7 million-strong pool of followers that includes customers, fans, investors, rivals, and the press. In 2013, Tesla said the executive could use his personal account to make important product announcements — a right he has often exercised — but never instated a procedure to vet the information he posts. The SEC wants to change that, and it has asked Tesla to put in additional controls and procedures to oversee Musk’s communications.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The total package of remedies and relief announced today are specifically designed to address the misconduct at issue by strengthening Tesla’s corporate governance and oversight in order to protect investors,” concluded Stephanie Avakian, the co-director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division, in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The settlement isn’t as harsh as it could have been. The SEC initially wanted to push Musk out as Tesla CEO, too, but backed down when it realized the company’s stock price would collapse without the outspoken executive at the helm. The chaos nonetheless wiped about $7 billion from Tesla’s market value, placing it below General Motors, by sending its stock price on a 14 percent free fall. Musk’s legal troubles aren’t over yet, either. Several investors sued him over his misleading tweet and the settlement bolsters the credibility of their case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla hasn’t responded to the settlement, but Musk reacted several days later by posting a fiery message on his personal Twitter account — where else? (For those who are not aware, short sellers profit from a drop in a company’s stock price.)\n",
      "\n",

      "In a new book likely to rekindle fierce controversy, psychologist Robert Plomin argues that genes largely shape our personalities and that the latest science is too compelling to ignore\n",
      "\n",
      "There are few areas of science more fiercely contested than the issue of what makes us who we are. Are we products of our environments or the embodiment of our genes? Is nature the governing force behind our behaviour or is it nurture? While almost everyone agrees that it’s a mixture of both, there has been no end of disagreement about which is the dominant influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s a disagreement that has been made yet more fraught by the political concerns that often underlie it. Traditionally, those on the left have tended to see the environment as the critical factor because it ties in with notions of egalitarianism. Thus inequalities, viewed from this perspective, are explained not by inherent differences but by social conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, those on the right have leaned towards a more Darwinian conception, in which different social outcomes are accounted for by differences of suitability to the environment. In turn, such an understanding has in the past led to the promotion of eugenics (both on the left and right) – through selective breeding, sterilisation and, in the case of the Nazis, wholesale murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a consequence, a shadow was cast across genetic research into human behaviour, particularly of the kind that centres on differences between population groups. Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein’s The Bell Curve, published in 1994, did just that, drawing controversial conclusions about the differing average IQ results of black and white Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Someone who defended the data in that book but took exception to its conclusions is the American psychologist and geneticist Robert Plomin, a pioneer of what’s sometimes called “hereditarian” science. In his new book, Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are, Plomin takes recent genetic research and draws some provocative conclusions, but they are about individuals rather than groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "In common with many other scientists, Plomin believes that Freud sent society looking in the wrong place for answers to the question of what makes us as we are. The key to personality traits does not lie in how you were treated by your parents, but rather in what you inherited biologically from them: namely, the genes in your DNA.\n",
      "\n",
      "He finds that genetic heritability accounts for 50% of the psychological differences between us, from personality to mental abilities. But that leaves 50% that should be accounted for by the environment. However, Plomin argues, research shows that most of that 50% is not attributable to the type of environmental influences that can be planned for or readily affected – ie it’s made up of unpredictable events. And of the environmental influences that can be moderated, much of it, he argues, is really an expression of genetics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Psychologist Robert Plomin of King’s College London: 30 years of genetic research lie behind his new book, Blueprint. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian\n",
      "\n",
      "As Plomin writes: “We now know that DNA differences are the major systematic source of psychological differences between us. Environmental effects are important but what we have learned in recent years is that they are mostly random – unsystematic and unstable – which means that we cannot do much about them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Plomin has been waiting 30 years to write Blueprint. It has taken him that long to conduct the research – much of it based on long-term twin studies – necessary to prove his case. But there was another reason for the delay, he admits: “cowardice”. For a long time, he says, it was “dangerous” to study “the genetic origins of differences in people’s behaviour and to write about it in scientific journals”.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ask him what he meant by this when I meet him at his office at the Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, which is located at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London in south London. Plomin is a towering figure, over 6ft 4in, with a broad frame and a meaty handshake, but his limpid blue eyes and softly spoken voice give him the appearance of a gentle giant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally from the United States, where he worked at the Institute for Behavioral Genetics at the University of Colorado, he explains that psychology has changed a great deal over the past 30 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Genetics articles – I mean it was verboten, really, in the 1970s. Everything was environmental. Even schizophrenia was thought to be due to what your mother did in the first few years of life. It seems ridiculous now, but that was the orthodoxy back then. And to mention genetics was just beyond the pale.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the world of science and psychology, he says, there is no longer any problem. But if you move out into other disciplines – he cites education as an example – “genetics is still the devil”. That said, he says brightening, it’s been decades since he’s been called a Nazi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since the development of genetics a century and a half ago, the discovery of DNA’s double-helix structure 65 years ago, and the mapping of the human genome 15 years ago, there has been an awareness that science was delving into secrets of Promethean flammability. While there has always been widespread acceptance that genes determine our physiology for good and bad, much greater controversy has surrounded the subject of our psychology – our behaviour and personality traits.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s one thing to state that genes largely determine how fast we run, how high we jump and how vulnerable we are to, say, myopia. But it’s another to argue that genes also largely determine how intelligent, empathetic or antisocial we are. We prefer to think of such traits as social constructions, brought about by the familial and social environments into which we happen to be born.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, if one child is subject to parental love and attention in comfortable, secure surroundings with plenty of intellectual stimulation, while another grows up in conditions of neglect and social deprivation, we expect the former to perform better at school and in life in general. And, by and large, they do, though Plomin believes that has less to do with social factors than biological ones. Once again, he says, it’s genetic inheritance, not conditions of upbringing, that makes the most difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1970s, everything was environmental. Even schizophrenia. To mention genetics was beyond the pale Robert Plomin\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a difficult concept to absorb for several reasons. The first is that we can all come up with examples in which environment would have a profound effect on outcome. For example, if you locked a child in a room and never taught that child to read or allowed it access to a book, then, released, that child at age 13, would, to say the least, display distinct learning difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plomin’s argument is that, in a society with universal education, the greatest part of the variation in learning abilities is accounted for by genetics, not home environment or quality of school – these factors, he says, do have an effect but it’s much smaller than is popularly believed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another problem that Plomin encounters with explaining his findings is that people often confuse group and individual differences – or, to put it another way, the distinction between means and variances. Thus, the average height of northern European males has increased by more than 15cm in the past two centuries. That is obviously due to changes in environment. However, the variation in height between northern European males is down to genetics. The same applies to psychological traits.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The causes of average differences,” he says, “aren’t necessarily related to causes of individual differences. So that’s why you can say heritability can be very high for a trait, but the average differences between groups – ethnic groups, gender – could be entirely environmental; for example, as a result of discrimination. The confusion between means and variances is a fundamental misunderstanding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For much of the relatively brief history of genetic science, there has been an even greater misunderstanding – the notion that the presence or absence of single genes is the determining factor that accounts for illnesses, abnormalities, dysfunctions, etc. Hence, some environmentalists have demanded to be shown the gene for various complaints and, when it is not produced, declare that there is no genetic explanation. But single-gene conditions are rare and, as far as anyone knows, nonexistent in psychology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The big breakthrough in the past few years is polygenic testing, which is able to correlate multiple genes – often thousands – with behaviour differences. No one yet understands the complex relationships between different genes, but Plomin points out that this is not necessary for predictive purposes. Polygenic testing, he says, comes up with heritability estimates that correspond to a whole range of physical and psychological traits. The larger the study group, the more accurate the predictions – and, as more and more people have their genome mapped, the study groups are growing all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re explaining more variance in GCSE scores than you can predict with anything else, including parents’ educational level and socioeconomic status,” says Plomin.\n",
      "\n",
      "One voluble critic of Plomin’s work has been the psychologist Oliver James, who believes that “sticking with the genetic story holds out no hope”. Instead he prefers to stick with the environmental story, which is a far richer narrative, full of parental missteps, social maltreatment and educational neglect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked James what question he would put to Plomin. He wanted to know what it would take for Plomin to accept that “genetic variants play little or no part in explaining transmission of human psychological traits from parent to child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Facebook Twitter Pinterest Schoolboys from Harrow and local boys outside the Eton vs Harrow cricket match, Lord’s, 1937. Could genetic factors play a part in social success, or is what school you go to more important? Photograph: Jimmy Sime/Allsport\n",
      "\n",
      "When I told Plomin that I had consulted James for his opinion, he rolled his eyes. He insists that James simply doesn’t understand or follow the developments that have taken place in recent years in genetics.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Show me a study that doesn’t find genetic influence. You can’t just say: ‘Oh, parents resemble kids and I think it’s environmental’. With DNA now, you have to take this polygenic score that’s been shown in 20 studies to predict educational attainment, and show me that it doesn’t. Oliver’s coming from straight Freudian psychoanalytical stuff, where that whole edifice was built up on no data.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A further argument made in Blueprint is that even those effects that are environmental may also be genetically influenced. This is what Plomin refers to as the “nature of nurture”. If we look at the correlation between parental socioeconomic status and their children’s educational and occupational outcomes, the tendency is to see it as environmental – better-educated parents pass on privilege, thus limiting social mobility.\n",
      "\n",
      "But genetics, writes Plomin, “turns the interpretation of this correlation upside down”. Instead, the socioeconomic status of parents might be viewed as a measure of their educational outcomes, which are heritable. So children benefit from their parents’ genes more than from their socioeconomic privilege.\n",
      "\n",
      "James believes that if, as a society, we accept the heritability argument, then it will lead to blaming the poor for their own plight and privileging the rich for their good fortune. He’s not alone. The Guardian ran an editorial earlier this year in response to a paper that Plomin (and others) published in which they stated that: “differences in exam performance between pupils attending selective and non-selective schools mirror the genetic differences between them”. The editorial described Plomin’s ideas as “pernicious and incendiary”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eric Turkheimer, leader of the Genetics and Human Agency Project at the University of Virginia, wrote a critique of the paper in which he accused the authors of describing genetic effects that could just as well have been environmental. “There is nothing in the paper to push one’s thinking in either a genetic or environmental direction,” he concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sticking with the genetic story holds out no hope Oliver James\n",
      "\n",
      "Plomin says his research is robust and it points in a genetic direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Guardian’s own conclusion amounted to a warning sign placed on Plomin’s work: “In understanding cognitive ability,” the editorial said, “we must not elevate discrimination to a science: allowing people to climb the ladder of life only as far as their cells might suggest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked if his findings support a rightwing, neo-Darwinian vision of society, Plomin responds: “There are no necessary policy implications of finding that genetics is the major systematic force making us who we are. Rightwing values might lead someone to say that we should educate the best and forget the rest, but my view is that the intellectual capital of a society depends on the many not just the few. Leftwing values might lead someone to say that we should put whatever resources are needed to bring children who didn’t draw good genetic cards at conception up to minimal levels of literacy and numeracy needed to participate in our increasingly technological world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If we do manage to iron out environmental differences, Plomin notes, we then have to accept the genetic differences that remain. Because, the more we reduce environmental differences, the more we highlight genetic differences. In other words, if we want equality of opportunity, then the price is having to acknowledge a genetically loaded inequality of outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "The psychologist believes that we have to go with the science, not settle on a story that suits our political sympathies. “It’s better to be right than wrong,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the most radical aspect of Plomin’s findings has little to do with the issue of equality, but instead seeks to rethink our treatment of mental health. At the moment, mental health follows the classical medical model by diagnosing a disorder and then seeking to deal with its cause. But genetic research suggests there are no clear lines in mental disorders, rather a spectrum on which we are all genetically placed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The example that Plomin gives is depression. If, say, there were 1,000 DNA differences found between two control groups of depressed and non-depressed people, it might be that in the general population the average person would have 500 of these depression-causing differences. And many people far fewer. Those with the fewest would be at least risk of becoming depressed and those with the most, at the greatest risk. It’s a question of probability, not certainty – an underlying predisposition, as it were, that might be triggered by unpredictable events.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This genetic research leads to a momentous conclusion,” writes Plomin. “There are no qualitative disorders, only quantitative dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That means you can’t cure a disorder, because there is no disorder,” he says. “It’s all quantitative. You can ameliorate the symptoms, which is what they do now with schizophrenia. They don’t try and cure the underlying problem. They just say: ‘There are some behaviours, and CBT can help people change their behaviours so they rub along better in life.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such thinking will no doubt be anathema to the very large and growing psychotherapeutic community, but for anyone who is baffled by the seemingly arbitrary diagnoses that have long been a characteristic of mental health, it makes a certain sense. Plomin believes that psychiatry is already adjusting to the findings by reclassifying some disorders as spectra; for example, schizophrenia spectrum disorder and autistic spectrum disorder. “Spectra,” he says, “is another word for dimensions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "All of which means that the distinction between “normal” and “abnormal” becomes not just more blurred but artificial. “They are merely the quantitive extremes of continuous traits,” says Plomin.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we come to the end of a long and thought-provoking discussion, I ask him how he thinks his book will be received. “I’m holding my breath,” he says, smiling. “I know it’s changed psychology, and it’s going to change clinical psychology. It’s changing all the life sciences, and eventually society will come along. But I think we’re at a tipping point, and what I’m holding my breath about is which way it’s going to tip.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Geneticists can make their cases over the strength of Plomin’s claims. For the rest of us, the temptation to jump to hasty conclusions may well prove too great. The social stakes, after all, are high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The possibilities for exploitation and abuse of genetic information are ones that have long been rehearsed in science fiction, and remain all too easy to imagine. But there is no progressive course of action that doesn’t address the scientific facts. For better or worse, ignorance is not an option.\n",

      "Even for people who love books, finding the opportunity to read can be a challenge. Many, then, rely on audiobooks, a convenient alternative to old-fashioned reading. You can listen to the latest bestseller while commuting or cleaning up the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is listening to a book really the same as reading one?\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was a fan of audiobooks, but I always viewed them as cheating,” says Beth Rogowsky, an associate professor of education at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania.\n",
      "\n",
      "More from TIME\n",
      "\n",
      "For a 2016 study, Rogowsky put her assumptions to the test. One group in her study listened to sections of Unbroken, a nonfiction book about World War II by Laura Hillenbrand, while a second group read the same parts on an e-reader. She included a third group that both read and listened at the same time. Afterward, everyone took a quiz designed to measure how well they had absorbed the material. “We found no significant differences in comprehension between reading, listening, or reading and listening simultaneously,” Rogowsky says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Score one for audiobooks? Maybe. But Rogowsky’s study used e-readers rather than traditional print books, and there’s some evidence that reading on a screen reduces learning and comprehension compared to reading from printed text. So it’s possible that, had her study pitted traditional books against audiobooks, old-school reading might have come out on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re wondering why printed books may be better than screen-based reading, it may have to do with your inability to gauge where you are in an electronic book. “As you’re reading a narrative, the sequence of events is important, and knowing where you are in a book helps you build that arc of narrative,” says Daniel Willingham, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia and author of Raising Kids Who Read. While e-readers try to replicate this by telling you how much of a book you have left, in a percentage or length of time to the end, this doesn’t seem to have the same narrative-orienting effect as reading from a traditional book.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that printed text is anchored to a specific location on a page also seems to help people remember it better than screen-based text, according to more research on the spatial attributes of traditional printed media. All this may be relevant to the audiobook vs. book debate because, like digital screens, audiobooks deny users the spatial cues they would use while reading from printed text.\n",
      "\n",
      "The self-directed rhythms associated with reading may also differentiate books from audiobooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About 10 to 15% of eye movements during reading are actually regressive—meaning [the eyes are] going back and re-checking,” Willingham explains. “This happens very quickly, and it’s sort of seamlessly stitched into the process of reading a sentence.” He says this reading quirk almost certainly bolsters comprehension, and it may be roughly comparable to a listener asking for a speaker to “hold on” or repeat something. “Even as you’re asking, you’re going over in your mind’s ear what the speaker just said,” he says. Theoretically, you can also pause or jump back while listening to an audio file. “But it’s more trouble,” he adds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another consideration is that whether we’re reading or listening to a text, our minds occasionally wander. Seconds (or minutes) can pass before we snap out of these little mental sojourns and refocus our attention, says David Daniel, a professor of psychology at James Madison University and a member of a National Academy of Sciences project aimed at understanding how people learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re reading, it’s pretty easy to go back and find the point at which you zoned out. It’s not so easy if you’re listening to a recording, Daniel says. Especially if you’re grappling with a complicated text, the ability to quickly backtrack and re-examine the material may aid learning, and this is likely easier to do while reading than while listening. “Turning the page of a book also gives you a slight break,” he says. This brief pause may create space for your brain to store or savor the information you’re absorbing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daniel coauthored a 2010 study that found students who listened to a podcast lesson performed worse on a comprehension quiz than students who read the same lesson on paper. “And the podcast group did a lot worse, not a little worse,” he says. Compared to the readers, the listeners scored an average of 28% lower on the quiz—about the difference between an A or a D grade, he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, at the start of the experiment, almost all the students wanted to be in the podcast group. “But then right before I gave them the quiz, I asked them again which group they would want to be in, and most of them had changed their minds—they wanted to be in the reading group,” Daniel says. “They knew they hadn’t learned as much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He says it’s possible that, with practice, the listeners might be able to make up ground on the readers. “We get good at what we do, and you could become a better listener if you trained yourself to listen more critically,” he says. (The same could be true of screen-based reading; some research suggests that people who practice “screen learning” get better at it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But there may also be some “structural hurdles” that impede learning from audio material, Daniels says. For one thing, you can’t underline or highlight something you hear. And many of the “This is important!” cues that show up in text books—things like bolded words or boxed bits of critical info—aren’t easily emphasized in audio-based media.\n",
      "\n",
      "But audiobooks also have some strengths. Human beings have been sharing information orally for tens of thousands of years, Willingham says, while the printed word is a much more recent invention. “When we’re reading, we’re using parts of the brain that evolved for other purposes, and we’re MacGyvering them so they can be applied to the cognitive task of reading,” he explains. Listeners, on the other hand, can derive a lot of information from a speaker’s inflections or intonations. Sarcasm is much more easily communicated via audio than printed text. And people who hear Shakespeare spoken out loud tend to glean a lot of meaning from the actor’s delivery, he adds.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a final factor may tip the comprehension and retention scales firmly in favor of reading, and that’s the issue of multitasking. “If you’re trying to learn while doing two things, you’re not going to learn as well,” Willingham says. Even activities that you can more or less perform on autopilot—stuff like driving or doing the dishes—take up enough of your attention to impede learning. “I listen to audiobooks all the time while I’m driving, but I would not try to listen to anything important to my work,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that said, if you’re reading or listening for leisure—not for work or study—the differences between audiobooks and print books are probably “small potatoes,” he adds. “I think there’s enormous overlap in comprehension of an audio text compared to comprehension of a print text.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So go ahead and “cheat.” Your book club buddies will never know.\n",

      "Verizon Wireless will start offering a 5G-based wireless home Internet service next month in parts of four US cities, with service coming to other cities at an as-yet-unspecified date.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Typical\" download speeds will be around 300Mbps. The max speed of nearly 1Gbps will be available \"depending on location,\" and there will be \"no data caps,\" Verizon said. The speeds are fast enough to rival Verizon's fiber-to-the-home service, and the carrier has previously claimed that its 5G network will have \"single-millisecond latencies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Verizon 5G Home will be available in parts of Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles and Sacramento beginning on October 1, and customers can sign up starting on Thursday morning, Verizon announced yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early users of the service in those four cities will get it for free for the first three months. \"After that introductory period, current Verizon Wireless customers with a qualifying smartphone plan will pay $50 per month for the service, while non-Verizon Wireless customers will pay $70 per month,\" Verizon said. \"This monthly charge includes all taxes and fees, and does not require an annual contract. There are no additional hardware costs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Customers will also get three free months of YouTube TV and a free Apple TV 4K or Google Chromecast Ultra, Verizon said.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're not in a launch area, you can sign up for updates about availability starting Thursday at this Verizon page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial availability will be limited to \"certain neighborhoods\" in the four launch cities. \"Verizon will rapidly expand its coverage area once we can install the new standards-compliant equipment from our vendors,\" the carrier said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlimited?\n",
      "\n",
      "While Verizon said its wireless home Internet service will have no data caps, Verizon's \"unlimited\" mobile services can be throttled during times of network congestion after customers use a certain amount each month. We asked Verizon if a similar limitation will be applied to 5G home Internet and will update this story if we a get a response. We also asked Verizon for the service's upload speeds and information about what equipment will be used in the home.\n",
      "\n",
      "(UPDATE: A Verizon spokesperson told us the service won't have any throttling. Service at each home will rely on a router, and possibly an exterior antenna \"depending on the customer's location,\" Verizon also told Ars.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Verizon said its 300Mbps to 1Gbps download speeds are achieved with \"deep fiber resources throughout the network\" and \"a large deployment of small cells.\" While the home Internet service uses multiple spectrum bands, Verizon said it is heavily dependent on millimeter wave frequencies, \"the only spectrum with the bandwidth to realize the full 5G potential for capacity, throughput and latency.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Verizon's wireless network already has the highest utilization rate among 80 mobile operators worldwide, according to a new study by Rewheel Research. \"Verizon was the operator with the highest yearly average capacity utilization of 57 percent in 2017,\" while most carriers were below 20 percent and the US average was 33 percent, the research group said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verizon's network limitations have been a hot topic recently, since the Santa Clara County fire departments complained that a device with an unlimited data plan was throttled while they were fighting California's largest-ever wildfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verizon's 5G mobile service hasn't launched yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "AT&T is also planning to launch a 5G home Internet service and has already begun trials. AT&T says its trials are providing speeds of nearly 1Gbps and latency of less than 20 milliseconds. T-Mobile US and Sprint, which are trying to merge, also say they'll offer home broadband service.\n",

      "\n",
      "Applications that pass in URLs to libcurl would of course still very often need to parse URLs, create URLs or otherwise handle them, but libcurl has not been helping with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the under-specification of URLs has led to a situation where there's really no stable document anywhere describing how URLs are supposed to work and basically every implementer is left to handle the WHATWG URL spec, RFC 3986 and the world in between all by themselves. Understanding how their URL parsing libraries, libcurl, other tools and their favorite browsers differ is complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "By offering applications access to libcurl's own URL parser, we hope to tighten a problematic vulnerable area for applications where the URL parser library would believe one thing and libcurl another. This could and has sometimes lead to security problems. (See for example Exploiting URL Parser in Trending Programming Languages! by Orange Tsai)\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, since libcurl deals with URLs and virtually every application using libcurl already does some amount of URL fiddling, it makes sense to offer it in the \"same package\".

      "The flaws impact Adobe’s ColdFusion product, which is the company’s commercial web application development platform. Impacted are the 2016 (Update 6 and earlier versions) and the July 12 (2018) release of ColdFusion, as well as ColdFusion 11 (Update 14 and earlier versions).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Adobe said ColdFusion contained nine flaws, including four critical deserialization of untrusted data flaws that could lead to arbitrary code-execution (CVE-2018-15965, CVE-2018-15957, CVE-2018-15958 and CVE-2018-15959). Additional flaws included one critical unrestricted file upload bug that could also lead to arbitrary code-execution (CVE-2018-15961) and one critical vulnerability that could enable arbitrary file-overwrite (CVE-2018-15960).\n",
      "\n",
      "Other vulnerabilities include an important-severity security bypass glitch that allows arbitrary folder creation (CVE-2018-15963), an important directory listing flaw that could enable information disclosure (CVE-2018-15962), and a moderate information-disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2018-15964).\n",
      "\n",
      "Adobe said it is not aware of any exploits in the wild for any of the issues addressed in the updates. The company recommends users update installations to ColdFusion 2018 Update 1, ColdFusion 2016 Update 7, and ColdFusion 11 Update 15.\n",

      "\n",
      "In addition to ColdFusion, Adobe also released a security update for Adobe Flash Player for Windows, macOS, Linux and Chrome OS. The update addresses an important-rated vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player Desktop Runtime, Flash Player for Google Chrome, and Flash Player for Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 – all for versions 30.0.0.154 and earlier.\n",

      "The future of battlefield communications is resting comfortably near your back gums.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next time you pass someone on the street who appears to be talking to themselves, they may literally have voices inside their head…and be a highly trained soldier on a dangerous mission. The Pentagon has inked a roughly $10 million contract with a California company to provide secure communication gear that’s essentially invisible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dubbed the Molar Mic, it’s a small device that clips to your back teeth. The device is both microphone and “speaker,” allowing the wearer to transmit without any conspicuous external microphone and receive with no visible headset or earpiece. Incoming sound is transmitted through the wearer’s bone matter in the jaw and skull to the auditory nerves; outgoing sound is sent to a radio transmitter on the neck, and sent to another radio unit that can be concealed on the operator. From there, the signal can be sent anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Essentially, what you are doing is receiving the same type of auditory information that you receive from your ear, except that you are using a new auditory pathway — through your tooth, through your cranial bones — to that auditory nerve. You can hear through your head as if you were hearing through your ear,” said Peter Hadrovic, CEO of Molar Mic creator Sonitus Technologies. He likened the experience to what happens when you eat a crunchy breakfast cereal — but instead of hearing that loud (delightfully marketable) chewing noise, you’re receiving important communications from your operations team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your ability to understand conversations transmitted through bone improves with practice. “Over the period of three weeks, your brain adapts and it enhances your ability to process the audio,” said Hadrovic. But even “out of the gate, you can understand it,” he said. (more below)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Molar Mic connects to its transmitter via near-field magnetic induction. It’s similar to Bluetooth, encryptable, but more difficult to detect and able to pass through water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sonitus received early funding from In-Q-Tel, the nonprofit investment arm of the CIA, to develop the concept. Hadrovic declined to say whether CIA operatives had used the device in intelligence gathering. But the Molar Mic has seen the dust of Afghanistan and even played a role in rescue operations in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Aug, 2016, a connection Hadrovic met through In-Q-Tel introduced the company to the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, or DIUx (since rebranded simply DIU). They linked Sonitus to their “warrior in residence” and several other pararescuemen, or PJs, from the Air National Guard’s 131st Rescue Squadron at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California, near the DIU headquarters. Pararescuemen airdrop behind enemy lines to rescue downed aircrews.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few of the airmen took prototypes of the device on deployment to Afghanistan. Although they didn’t use it during missions, they were able to test it repeatedly and offer feedback. Hadrovic said the 14 months of testing were critical to improving the product for use by the military.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, a few of the PJs from the 131st brought Molar Mic along when they deployed to Texas to help with rescue operations for Hurricane Harvey. Hadrovic said the airmen were pleased with its performance during complicated operations involving water, helicopters, and a lot of external noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This guy is standing in neck-deep water, trying to hoist a civilian up into a helicopter above. He says, ‘There is no way I would be able to communicate with the crew chief and the pilot if I was not wearing your product.’” (More below)\n",
      "\n",
      "A graph illustrating the communications network of the “Molar Mic” from Sonitus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same technology holds the potential for far more rich biometric communication between operators and their commanders, allowing soldiers in the field and their team to get a timely sense of how the soldier is responding to pressure or injury, without him or her having to communicate all of that explicitly. It’s something that the military is working toward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As we look to the future human-machine interface… the human creates a lot of information, some of it intentional, some of it unintentional. Speaking is one form of information creation,” says Hadrovic. “Once you’ve made something digital, the information can be interspersed…We have a tremendous wealth of opportunities to communicate out of the person and back to the person, information that can be either collected from them and processed offline and given back in a nice feedback loop. What we’ve done is invested in the platform that will support these future elements.”\n",

      "Two years before Equifax Inc. stunned the world with the announcement it had been hacked, the credit-reporting company believed it was the victim of another theft, only this time at the hands of Chinese spies, according to people familiar with the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the previously undisclosed incident, security officials feared that former employees had removed thousands of pages of proprietary information before leaving and heading to jobs in China. Materials included code for planned new products, human-resources files and manuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equifax went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. Investigators from the company and the FBI came to view events at Equifax as potentially a huge theft of data—not of consumers’ personal data, as happened with the subsequent 2017 hacking of Equifax’s files, but of confidential business information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equifax security officials briefed the then-chief executive, Richard Smith, at a fall 2015 meeting, spreading high stacks of paper across the length of the boardroom table. The voluminous printouts represented what they feared was stolen. Adding to suspicions, the Chinese government had recently asked eight companies to help it build a national credit-reporting system.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point, Equifax grew so worried it began building a way to monitor the computer activity of all of its ethnic-Chinese employees, according to people familiar with the investigation. The resource-heavy project, which raised legal concerns internally, was short-lived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Some investigators believed Equifax’s intense focus on the matter contributed to a delay in the company’s understanding the extent of the 2017 hack of consumers’ information, an event that hammered Equifax’s stock, cost some executives their jobs, including Mr. Smith, and damaged the company’s reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the previously undisclosed investigation undertaken by the FBI stalled. The FBI wanted to pursue a criminal case, believing the theft of trade secrets costs the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars a year, with China the leading offender, said people familiar with the investigation. Equifax began to worry about legal exposure and how onerous the inquiry could become, according to these people, and eventually reduced its cooperation with law enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "That left many of the questions raised by the investigation, both about Equifax and about China, unresolved.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Equifax, in a written statement, said it became aware in 2015 of “efforts by a former employee to obtain company information, and launched an internal investigation into his activities.” The company “brought the investigation to the attention of U.S. law enforcement authorities and cooperated with the federal agencies,” Equifax said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Although this individual had improperly obtained proprietary Equifax information,” the statement said, “the information we determined was accessed was general in nature and not material or harmful to Equifax, consumers or our business clients.” Equifax said the company has “no evidence to suggest that consumer data or other personal information was compromised, or that this individual targeted this type of information.”\n",

      "Equifax didn’t address in its statement whether it thought other employees were involved. A person familiar with the company’s thinking disputed the notion that Equifax reduced its cooperation with law enforcement in a probe it had itself triggered.\n",

      "One of the former employees Equifax and the FBI investigated in connection with a possible business-information theft was Daniel Zou, who worked in Toronto. The company he joined in China was Ant Financial, a fast-growing financial-technology affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , founded by billionaire Jack Ma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Ant and Mr. Zou denied any involvement in taking proprietary Equifax data. Alibaba referred questions to Ant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ant, based in Hangzhou, China, said it “has never used Equifax code, scripts or algorithms in the development of its own products and services.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Zou, in a sworn statement provided by his lawyer, said, “I deny that I worked with or consulted with a network of Equifax colleagues to steal Equifax code for Ant Financial or that I provided any such code to Ant Financial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviewed by The Wall Street Journal in Washington, Mr. Zou, a 35-year-old Chinese-born Canadian citizen who graduated from the University of Toronto, repeated his denial and said that learning from the Journal of Equifax’s suspicions had been “a nightmare.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Those suspicions arose in 2015, a few months after Mr. Zou left his job as an Equifax product manager to join Ant’s new credit-scoring business, which is known as Sesame Credit in English. Ant was among the companies asked by China’s central bank to develop credit-scoring services. Sesame launched its service in January 2015, several months before Mr. Zou came aboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equifax’s data-loss prevention system, which guards against sensitive information leaving the corporate network, flagged the activities of Mr. Zou, according to people familiar with the investigation. The system alerted that an employee might have taken data off the network, and initially registered it as benign, they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Zou said in his interview with the Journal that, according to his understanding of how the system works, it would warn the person removing the data on the spot. He said he never received such a warning. Equifax declined to say whether that is how the system works or whether Mr. Zou received a warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, Equifax officials also had suspicions about a different employee, in another city. Equifax’s security chief, Susan Mauldin, approached the FBI with a question: What would it look like if we were being targeted by China?\n",
      "\n",
      "FBI officials told her that in one common technique, a group makes plans to visit a company’s office to pitch a partnership, then at the last minute replaces delegation members with spies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around this time, a delegation from a Chinese business visited Equifax and swapped out some members at the last minute, fueling Equifax’s suspicions it was a target.\n",
      "\n",
      "Company security officials decided to examine Mr. Zou’s computer activity. They discovered he had printed out thousands of pages of company information. The material related to the way credit scores are obtained, what different pieces of data mean and how to apply algorithms to assess troves of data, according to the people familiar with the investigation. They said some was information that could help explain products Equifax was working on.\n",
      "\n",
      "At around the same time they were examining Mr. Zou’s systems, investigators discovered what they believed to be a major infiltration campaign. They found that other employees had sent code to their personal email accounts and uploaded it to software-development platforms others could access.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the people familiar with the probe, the investigators, by talking to Equifax employees and examining email accounts and LinkedIn messages sent to them, saw indications that recruiters purporting to represent Ant affiliate Alibaba had offered to triple salaries for certain ethnically Chinese Equifax employees—and provided instructions on specific Equifax information they should bring along if they jumped ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigators saw, as well, that Mr. Zou had searched the Equifax human-resources system to look up data analytics teams in the U.S. He had printed out contact information for many ethnic-Chinese employees, according to people familiar with the probe. They said some of those employees told colleagues they were later contacted by recruiters who claimed to be working on behalf of Alibaba.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigators found notes on Chinese messaging service WeChat in which another group of Equifax employees in North America, using their company-issued phones, arranged off-hours meetings to discuss work projects and left the company soon after, saying they were going to Ant or Sesame for big raises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ant said Mr. Zou is the only former Equifax employee it has hired since it began collecting employment history information in 2011. Ant said Mr. Zou began at its credit-scoring business in May 2015. It listed a five-figure starting salary for Mr. Zou and said he wasn’t promised any large bonuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ant said it didn’t “directly or indirectly through third-party recruiters” encourage job applicants to steal Equifax information. Ant prohibits employees and recruiters from requesting such activity, the company said, adding that third-party recruiters aren’t authorized to make job offers on its behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ant said it hadn’t been contacted by Equifax or any government investigators about such matters. After receiving an inquiry from the Journal about Mr. Zou, Ant said, it investigated his information-technology activities and found no evidence he had ever provided Ant with any Equifax code, scripts or algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Zou said he worked in marketing and didn’t have access to Equifax code, algorithms and other proprietary information; never took any to Ant; wasn’t asked to; and never encouraged others to.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I deny that I searched an internal Equifax human resources database to recruit Equifax employees to join Ant Financial,” Mr. Zou said in the sworn declaration provided by a lawyer. “I further deny that I printed contact information for ethnic-Chinese Equifax employees as part of an effort to recruit such employees to join Ant Financial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Journal interview, Mr. Zou said, “I think [where] this might come from is that during my time at Equifax I had a habit of sending work-related documents to my own email so that I could work at home. If any of those contain [any] of what they call the alleged proprietary information, right after I left Equifax and before I went back to China, I deleted them all. And I did not share that with anybody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If investigators were alarmed by his email practices, Mr. Zou said, “I think that’s a huge misunderstanding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Zou also said he printed out employee contact information for projects that required him to work with global colleagues. “Equifax Canada did not want to reinvent the wheel from beginning,” he said, “so my job was to piggyback the success case” from the company’s U.S., U.K. and Latin American regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said he disposed of all the documents before moving to China and joining Ant, and he denied targeting any ethnicity. “If you search a data analytics team, the likelihood is high that you will reach a Chinese employee,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Zou said he had never been contacted by Equifax or any government authorities about data theft, and learning he was suspected caused him “emotional turmoil.”\n",

      "Although Equifax had gone to the FBI—and although the bureau was eager to pursue the matter—Equifax officials by the middle of 2016 had grown wary of providing more information to federal investigators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equifax worried that doing so could trigger requirements under securities law for disclosure of material information, said the people familiar with the investigation. They said Equifax also was concerned that handing over access to its entire network, including international operations, as the FBI had requested, could run afoul of obligations in some countries where Equifax operates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the middle of 2016, Equifax told its internal investigators to comply with any potential subpoenas but to stop proactively providing information to law enforcement, said the people familiar with the investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The person familiar with Equifax who disputed the notion the company directed employees to be uncooperative said: “As the investigation progressed, we did ask that requests for information be passed through our legal office to ensure we were adhering to standard legal protocols.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Equifax continued to monitor certain employees through 2016 and 2017. It eventually confronted several ethnically Chinese employees over activities found in its investigation, who left before the company took further action, according to people familiar with the probe.\n",
      "\n",
      "FBI officials in Atlanta got the impression from Equifax’s then-CEO, Mr. Smith, and legal staff that the company didn’t believe it generally had information valuable enough to be the target of a major Chinese campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Smith told colleagues even if thieves had taken code, they didn’t have Equifax’s consumer data, which meant the theft wouldn’t pose a competitive threat. Moreover, Equifax didn’t see a material impact on current operations because the information that appeared to have been stolen related to products in development, not to existing ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. attorney’s office in Atlanta ultimately determined it didn’t have evidence the suspected thefts were directed by the Chinese government, a top priority for law enforcement. The prosecutors decided they wouldn’t pursue a case against any individual, since Equifax wasn’t eager to do so, and since what former employees were suspected of taking was corporate information, rather than anything directly affecting U.S. consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, in September 2017, came blockbuster news from Equifax: the disclosure that a hacking of its files had exposed highly sensitive personal data on more than 140 million Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equifax had learned six months earlier, in March 2017, of a software vulnerability, but waited months to fully check its encrypted traffic to see whether it had been breached. Only in July 2017 did Equifax realize the hack had exposed personal information, including Social Security numbers and dates of birth, of nearly half the U.S. population.\n",
      "\n",
      "This delay was partially due to Equifax’s failure to resolve a dispute between its technology and information-security staffs at a time when top security people were focused on possible infiltration from China, in the opinion of some of the people familiar with the investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The person familiar with Equifax’s thinking said the hack involved both human error and technological failure, and Equifax has been forthcoming about the causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the weeks following the disclosure of that giant 2017 breach, Mr. Smith resigned, as did Ms. Mauldin and Equifax’s chief information officer, David Webb. All either couldn’t be reached or didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In January 2018, Chinese officials rolled out a state-backed credit-scoring company and gave Ant Financial an 8% stake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Zou has returned to Canada. Ant transferred him from Sesame Credit to its Alipay international business unit in Hangzhou in mid-2017. On June 1 of this year, he moved to Alipay Canada in Vancouver.\n",

Each finding includes a request, associated session rules or macros, and logic to detect presence of the vulnerability. The tester sends the Replicator file to the client alongside the report. Developers can then open the file within Burp and replicate the issues.

      "“You can’t hack what isn’t there,” Very Good Security co-founder Mahmoud Abdelkader tells me. His startup assumes the liability of storing sensitive data for other companies, substituting dummy credit card or Social Security numbers for the real ones. Then when the data needs to be moved or operated on, VGS injects the original info without clients having to change their code.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s essentially a data bank that allows businesses to stop storing confidential info under their unsecured mattress. Or you could think of it as Amazon Web Services for data instead of servers. Given all the high-profile breaches of late, it’s clear that many companies can’t be trusted to house sensitive data. Andreessen Horowitz is betting that they’d rather leave it to an expert.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why the famous venture firm is leading an $8.5 million Series A for VGS, and its partner Alex Rampell is joining the board. The round also includes NYCA, Vertex Ventures, Slow Ventures and PayPal mafioso Max Levchin. The cash builds on VGS’ $1.4 million seed round, and will pay for its first big marketing initiative and more salespeople.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey! Stop doing this yourself!,” Abdelkader asserts. “Put it on VGS and we’ll let you operate on your data as if you possess it with none of the liability.” While no data is ever 100 percent unhackable, putting it in VGS’ meticulously secured vaults means clients don’t have to become security geniuses themselves and instead can focus on what’s unique to their business.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Privacy is a part of the UN Declaration of Human Rights. We should be able to build innovative applications without sacrificing our privacy and security,” says Abdelkader. He got his start in the industry by reverse-engineering games like StarCraft to build cheats and trainer software. But after studying discrete mathematics, cryptology and number theory, he craved a headier challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abdelkader co-founded Y Combinator-backed payment system Balanced in 2010, which also raised cash from Andreessen. But out-muscled by Stripe, Balanced shut down in 2015. While transitioning customers over to fellow YC alumni Stripe, Balanced received interest from other companies wanting it to store their data so they could be PCI-compliant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now Abdelkader and his VP from Balanced, Marshall Jones, have returned with VGS to sell that as a service. It’s targeting startups that handle data like payment card information, Social Security numbers and medical info, though eventually it could invade the larger enterprise market. It can quickly help these clients achieve compliance certifications for PCI, SOC2, EI3PA, HIPAA and other standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "VGS’ innovation comes in replacing this data with “format preserving aliases” that are privacy safe. “Your app code doesn’t know the difference between this and actually sensitive data,” Abdelkader explains. In 30 minutes of integration, apps can be reworked to route traffic through VGS without ever talking to a salesperson. VGS locks up the real strings and sends the aliases to you instead, then intercepts those aliases and swaps them with the originals when necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t actually see your data that you vault on VGS,” Abdelkader tells me. “It’s basically modeled after prison. The valuables are stored in isolation.” That means a business’ differentiator is their business logic, not the way they store data.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, fintech startup LendUp works with VGS to issue virtual credit card numbers that are replaced with fake numbers in LendUp’s databases. That way if it’s hacked, users’ don’t get their cards stolen. But when those card numbers are sent to a processor to actually make a payment, the real card numbers are subbed in last-minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "VGS charges per data record and operation, with the first 500 records and 100,000 sensitive API calls free; $20 a month gets clients double that, and then they pay 4 cent per record and 2 cents per operation. VGS provides access to insurance too, working with a variety of underwriters. It starts with $1 million policies that can be much larger for Fortune 500s and other big companies, which might want $20 million per incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, VGS has to be obsessive about its own security. A breach of its vaults could kill its brand. “I don’t sleep. I worry I’ll miss something. Are we a giant honey pot?,” Abdelkader wonders. “We’ve invested a significant amount of our money into 24/7 monitoring for intrusions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the threat of hackers, VGS also has to battle with others picking away at part of its stack or trying to compete with the whole, like TokenEx, HP’s Voltage, Thales’ Vormetric, Oracle and more. But it’s do-it-yourself security that’s the status quo and what VGS is really trying to disrupt.\n",
      "\n",
      "But VGS has a big accruing advantage. Each time it works with a clients’ partners like Experian or TransUnion for a company working with credit checks, it already has a relationship with them the next time another clients has to connect with these partners. Abdelkader hopes that, “Effectively, we become a standard of data security and privacy. All the institutions will just say ‘why don’t you use VGS?'”\n",
      "\n",
      "That standard only works if it’s constantly evolving to win the cat-and-mouse game versus attackers. While a company is worrying about the particular value it adds to the world, these intelligent human adversaries can find a weak link in their security — costing them a fortune and ruining their relationships. “I’m selling trust,” Abdelkader concludes. That peace of mind is often worth the price.\n",

      "Japan’s police and military are to separately begin tests of artificial intelligence systems to predict crimes and the activities of suspicious vessels at sea, including the potential threats foreign ships may pose to Japanese territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Police Agency is to request Y144 million (US$1.29 million) in its budget for 2019 to test the ability of artificial intelligence to forecast crimes like money laundering, terrorist attacks at major public events and incidents involving vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mainichi newspaper said a system capable of predicting the likelihood and possible location of crimes would eventually be rolled out to police forces across the country “as soon as possible” to make efforts to avert criminal activity more effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "“From a security point of view, Japan is perhaps one of the least advanced nations in the world simply because we have a relatively low level of crime,” said Morinosuke Kawaguchi, an innovation and technology consultant. “The US and the UK are perhaps the most advanced in this area, with the police in Chicago, for example, already using a crime forecasting system that uses data to intervene before crimes are even committed. It’s like something out of the science fiction movie Minority Report.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The system is able to analyse vast amounts of data – everything from traffic frequency to a district’s economic situation, the weather and the time of day – to identify potential trouble spots, at which point police cars can be dispatched to patrol and deter criminal activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The force is aiming to develop AI algorithms that will enable them to identify unusual financial transactions from the vast amounts of transfers that occur every day. The programme would use data from financial institutions and credit card companies, focusing particularly on dormant accounts that suddenly receive large amounts of money or are involved in numerous international transfers in a short period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly 400,000 questionable transactions were reported to the division that overseas money laundering efforts last year, placing a huge strain on resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another AI programme will be developed to identify and track cars that are suspected of being stolen or are being used in a crime, even if the data on a vehicle’s movements are incomplete.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third area of research will be designed to avert terrorist attacks – a concern for the Japanese government, Kawaguchi said, as Tokyo prepares to host the 2020 Olympic Games.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Facial recognition systems have already been developed elsewhere that are able to predict with around 80 per cent accuracy whether a person is involved in a crime by identifying signs of anger, stress or something else that indicates they are planning to so something bad,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Defence Ministry is also looking at using AI to identify ships operating suspiciously or that might pose a threat to Japanese territory, the Yomiuri newspaper reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system could be deployed as early as 2021 and will allow Japanese aircraft and warships to analyse information from the Automatic Identification System installed on ships. The programme will be designed to issue an alert when a vessel strays from its most appropriate course or acts in an unusual manner and permit Maritime Self-Defence Force vessels to intervene if North Korean freighters conduct ship-to-ship transfers of items banned under the United Nations’ sanctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The technology will also enable authorities to monitor the movements of ships that turn off their AIS by tracking a vessel’s wake by satellite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of even greater concern is guaranteeing the integrity of the resources that fall within its exclusive economic zone or disputed territories, said Kawaguchi, such as the Diaoyu Islands, which Beijing also claims and Tokyo calls the Senkaku Islands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is clear that many of the Chinese fishing boats that operate in the East China Sea are not fishing at all but are controlled by the Chinese government and are carrying out spying missions,” Kawaguchi insisted. “An AI system will permit the SDF to keep a closer watch on those vessels\n",
      "\n",
      "and help them identify which ones are genuine fishing boats and which are not.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, grew 3.8 percent, which is estimated at 3.9 percent and revised from 4 percent. That reflects downward revisions in motor vehicles, nondurable goods, health care spending.\n",

      "\n",
      "Household purchases, which account for about 70 percent of the economy, have been supported by a strong job market and lower taxes. In addition, a rise in gasoline costs earlier this year has eased, reducing a risk to spending.\n",

      "\n",
      "A vulnerability in the Philips IntelliSpace Cardiovascular (ISCV) line of medical data management products would allow privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution – opening the door for an attacker to siphon out all kinds of confidential patient information, including medical images and full diagnostic details.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to an ICS-CERT alert issued this week, an attacker with local access to the ISCV/Xcelera server could use the flaw to gain administrative access, and from there be able to open folders which contain executables where authenticated users have write permission. That would allow a bad actor to execute information-exfiltrating malware, backdoors, ransomware or any other kind of bad code he or she chose. He or she could also pivot to other parts of the network, if the systems haven’t been properly partitioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the potential damage doesn’t stop at patient privacy, the amount of data that the flaw could offer access to is notable. The ICSV is a comprehensive information management software that’s used by medical personnel to maintain patients’ cardiovascular clinical information, including cardiac imaging files. Features include the “Cardiology Timeline,” which provides a “panoramic chronological overview of your patients’ cardiovascular care continuum,” according to the Philips website.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ISCV also offers the ability to launch into third-party applications that offer correlating information on a “system, patient, study and series level” – meaning that potential data exposure could be much larger than what the ISCV itself is home to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vulnerability (CVE-2018-14787) has a base CVSS score of 7.3, making it a medium-severity flaw. That’s because that although it requires only a low skill level to exploit it for severe privacy infractions, success requires an attacker to have local network access to the software to begin with – which would require the exploit of some other vulnerability (or status as a legitimate user).\n",
      "\n",
      "The affected products are the ISCV version 3.1 or earlier, and the Xcelera version 4.1 or earlier. A patch is scheduled to be released in October 2018 with ISCV Version 3.2, according to Philips.\n",
      "\n",
      "As interim mitigation tactics to the vulnerabilities until ISCV Version 3.2 can be applied, users should take basic precautions and apply network sequestration practices: restrict available permissions wherever possible; minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems; ensure that they’re not accessible from the internet; locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls (and isolate them from the business network); and use VPNs when remote access is required.\n",

      "\"I was finally able to process all the dark stuff that happened,\" Nicholas Blackston, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, told The New York Times, describing his experience with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. \"I was able to forgive myself. It was like a clean sweep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "MDMA, which was banned by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1985, could be available by prescription as soon as 2021. The rehabilitation of MDMA, a.k.a. \"ecstasy\" or \"molly,\" is directly related to the rehabilitation of veterans like Blackston, who participated in a study that confirmed the drug's potential as a catalyst for catharsis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial was sponsored by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) and reported on May 1 in The Lancet Psychiatry. It involved 22 military veterans, three firefighters, and one police officer, all of whom had been diagnosed with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \"resulting from traumatic experience during their service.\" The researchers, led by Charleston, South Carolina, psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer, randomly assigned the participants to receive 30, 75, or 125 milligrams of MDMA in conjunction with two psychotherapy sessions separated by about a month. The lowest dose served as an \"active placebo.\" Neither the researchers nor the subjects knew who was receiving which amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results were striking. Average scores on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), which indicates symptom severity, fell by 71 percent in the medium-dose group and 49 percent in the high-dose group, compared to 13 percent in the low-dose group. Sixty-eight percent of the medium- and high-dose subjects no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, compared to 29 percent of the low-dose subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "When people in the control group were given the opportunity to use higher doses of MDMA, they saw additional progress. One year after the MDMA sessions, the mean CAPS score for all subjects was 39, down from 87 at the beginning of the study. The cutoff for a PTSD diagnosis is 50.\n",
      "\n",
      "These large, persistent improvements reinforce the results of an earlier MAPS-sponsored study that provided MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to crime victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is Phase 3 clinical trials, which are the last stage before the Food and Drug Administration decides whether to approve the drug as a treatment for PTSD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last August, the agency streamlined that process by deeming MDMA a \"breakthrough therapy,\" meaning it \"may demonstrate substantial improvement\" over current options. Mithoefer notes that \"at least one in two PTSD patients cannot tolerate or do not respond adequately to existing treatments.\" MAPS plans to start the Phase 3 studies this summer.\n",

It is, therefore, an unexpected but delightful surprise to find myself excited and invigorated to be returning to Jean-Luc Picard and to explore new dimensions within him. Seeking out new life for him, when I thought that life was over. During these past years, it has been humbling to hear stories about how The Next Generation brought people comfort, saw them through difficult periods in their lives or how the example of Jean-Luc inspired so many to follow in his footsteps, pursuing science, exploration and leadership. I feel I’m ready to return to him for the same reason – to research and experience what comforting and reforming light he might shine on these often very dark times. I look forward to working with our brilliant creative team as we endeavor to bring a fresh, unexpected and pertinent story to life once more.\n",

Twenty years will have passed — more or less exactly the time between the last movie (Nemesis) and today. We have no scripts, as yet. We’re just talking, talking, talking storylines. It will be, I promise, I guarantee, something very, very different.

      "I've been talking a lot lately about the unfortunate shift of the web from being more decentralized to being about a few giant silos and I expect to have plenty more to say on the topic in the near future. But I'm thinking about this again after Andy Baio reminded me that this past weekend was five years since Google turned off Google Reader. Though, as he notes, Google's own awful decision making created the diminished use that allowed Google to justify shutting it down. Here's Andy's tweeted thread, and then I'll tie it back to my thinking on the silo'd state of the web today:\n",
      "\n",
      "Google Reader shut down five years ago today, and I’m still kind of pissed about it. — Andy Baio (@waxpancake) July 1, 2018 Google ostensibly killed Reader because of declining usage, but it was a self-inflicted wound. A 2011 redesign removed all its social features, replaced with Google+ integration, destroying an amazing community in the process. — Andy Baio (@waxpancake) July 1, 2018 The audience for Google Reader would never be as large or as active as modern social networks, but it was a critical and useful tool for independent writers and journalists, and for the dedicated readers who subscribed to their work. — Andy Baio (@waxpancake) July 1, 2018 There are great feedreaders out there — I use Feedly myself, but people love Newsblur, Feedbin, Inoreader, The Old Reader, etc. But Google Reader was a *community* and not easily replaced. Google fragmented an entire ecosystem, for no good reason, and it never recovered. — Andy Baio (@waxpancake) July 1, 2018\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people have pointed to the death of Google Reader as a point at which news reading online shifted from things like RSS feeds to proprietary platforms like Facebook and Twitter. It might seem odd (or ironic) to bemoan a move by one of the companies now considered one of the major silos for killing off a product, but it does seem to indicate a fundamental shift in the way that Google viewed the open web. A quick Google search (yeah, yeah, I know...) is not helping me find the quote, but I pretty clearly remember, in the early days of Google, one of Larry Page or Sergey Brin saying something to the effect of how the most important thing for Google was to get you off its site as quickly as possible. The whole point of Google was to take you somewhere else on the amazing web. Update It has been pointed out to me that the quote in question most likely is part of Larry Page's interview with Playboy in which he responded to the fact that in the early days all of their competitors were \"portals\" that tried to keep you in with the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "We built a business on the opposite message. We want you to come to Google and quickly find what you want. Then we’re happy to send you to the other sites. In fact, that’s the point. The portal strategy tries to own all of the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somewhere along the way, that changed. It seems that much of the change was really an overreaction by Google leadership to the \"threat\" of Facebook. So many of Google's efforts from the late 2000s until now seemed to have been designed to ward off Facebook. This includes not just Google's multiple (often weird) attempts at building a social network, but also Google's infatuation with getting users to sign in just to use its core search engine. Over the past decade or so, Google went very strongly from a company trying to get you off its site quickly to one that tried to keep you in. And it feels like the death of Reader was a clear indication of that shift. Reader started in the good old days, when the whole point of an RSS reader was to help you keep track of new stuff all over the web on individual sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, as Andy noted above, part of what killed Reader was Google attempting desperately to use it as a tool to boost Google+, the exact opposite of what Google Reader stood for in helping people go elsewhere. I don't think Google Reader alone would have kept RSS or the open web more thriving than it is today, but it certainly does feel like a landmark shift in the way Google itself viewed its mission: away from helping you get somewhere else, and much more towards keeping you connected to Google's big data machine.\n",

      "You are your Metadata: Identiﬁcation and Obfuscation of Social Media Users using Metadata Information Beatrice Perez1 , Mirco Musolesi1,2 , Gianluca Stringhini1 1University College London, London, UK 2The Alan Turing Institute, London, UK (beatrice.perez.14, m.musolesi, g.stringhini)@ucl.ac.uk Abstract Metadata are associated to most of the information we pro- duce in our daily interactions and communication in the dig- ital world. Yet, surprisingly, metadata are often still catego- rized as non-sensitive. Indeed, in the past, researchers and practitioners have mainly focused on the problem of the iden- tiﬁcation of a user from the content of a message. In this paper, we use Twitter as a case study to quantify the uniqueness of the association between metadata and user identity and to understand the effectiveness of potential ob- fuscation strategies. More speciﬁcally, we analyze atomic ﬁelds in the metadata and systematically combine them in an effort to classify new tweets as belonging to an account us- ing different machine learning algorithms of increasing com- plexity. We demonstrate that through the application of a su- pervised learning algorithm, we are able to identify any user in a group of 10,000 with approximately 96.7% accuracy. Moreover, if we broaden the scope of our search and con- sider the 10 most likely candidates we increase the accuracy of the model to 99.22%. We also found that data obfuscation is hard and ineffective for this type of data: even after per- turbing 60% of the training data, it is still possible to classify users with an accuracy higher than 95%. These results have strong implications in terms of the design of metadata obfus- cation strategies, for example for data set release, not only for Twitter, but, more generally, for most social media platforms. Introduction Platforms like Facebook, Flickr, and Reddit allow users to share links, documents, images, videos, and thoughts. Data has become the newest form of currency and analyzing data is both a business and an academic endeavor. When online social networks (OSNs) were ﬁrst introduced, privacy was not a major concern for users and therefore not a priority for service providers. With time, however, privacy concerns have risen: users started to consider the implications of the information they share (Stutzman, Gross, and Acquisti 2013; Humphreys, Gill, and Krishnamurthy 2010) and in response OSN platforms have introduced coarse controls for users to manage their data (De Cristofaro et al. 2012). Indeed, this concern is heightened by the fact that this descriptive infor- mation can be actively analyzed and mined for a variety of c(cid:13) 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artiﬁcial Copyright Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. purposes, often beyond the original design goals of the plat- forms. For example, information collected for targeted ad- vertisement might be used to understand political and reli- gious inclinations of a user. The problem is also exacerbated by the fact that often these datasets might be publicly re- leased either as part of a campaign or through information leaks. Previous work shows that the content of a message posted on an OSN platform reveals a wealth of information about its author. Through text analysis, it is possible to derive age, gender, and political orientation of individuals (Rao et al. 2010); the general mood of groups (Bollen, Mao, and Pepe 2011) and the mood of individuals (Tang et al. 2012). Image analysis reveals, for example, the place a photo was taken (Hays and Efros 2008), the place of residence of the photographer (Jahanbakhsh, King, and Shoja 2012), or even the relationship status of two individuals (Shoshi- taishvili, Kruegel, and Vigna 2015). If we look at mobility data from location-based social networks, the check-in be- havior of users can tell us their cultural background (Silva et al. 2014) or identify users uniquely in a crowd (Rossi and Musolesi 2014). Finally, even if an attacker only had access to anonymized datasets, by looking at the structure of the network someone may be able to re-identify users (Narayanan and Shmatikov 2009). Most if not all of these conclusions could be considered privacy-invasive by users, and therefore the content is what most service providers are starting to protect. However, access control lists are not suf- ﬁcient. We argue that the behavioral information contained in the metadata is just as informative. Metadata has become a core component of the services of- fered by OSNs. For example, Twitter provides information on users mentioned in a post, the number of times a mes- sage was re-tweeted, when a document was uploaded, and the number of interactions of a user with the system, just to name a few. These are not merely extra information: users rely on these to measure the credibility of an account (Wang et al. 2013) and much of the previous research in ﬁghting social spam relies on account metadata for detection (Ben- evenuto et al. 2010; Stringhini, Kruegel, and Vigna 2010). In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the iden- tiﬁcation risk posed by metadata to a user account. We treat identiﬁcation as a classiﬁcation problem and use supervised learning algorithms to build behavioral signatures for each of the users. Our analysis is based on metadata associated to micro-blog services like Twitter: each tweet contains the metadata of the post as well as that of the account from which it was posted. However, it is worth noting that the methods presented in this work are generic and can be ap- plied to a variety of social media platforms with similar char- acteristics in terms of metadata. In that sense, Twitter should be considered only as a case study, but the methods pro- posed in this paper are of broad applicability. The proposed techniques can be used in several practical scenarios such as when the identiﬁer of an account changes over time, when a single user creates multiple accounts, or in the detection of legitimate accounts that have been hijacked by malicious users. In security, there are at least two areas that look at identity from opposite perspectives: on one hand research in authentication looks for methods that, while unobtru- sive and usable, consistently identify users with low false positive rates (Patel et al. 2016); and, on the other hand, work on obfuscation and differential privacy aims to ﬁnd ways by which we can preserve an individual’s right to privacy by making information about them indistinguish- able in a set (Li, Li, and Venkatasubramanian 2007). This study is relevant to both: we claim that in the same way that our behavior in the physical world is used to iden- tify us (Bailey, Okolica, and Peterson 2014; Bo et al. 2013; Wang and Geng 2009), the interactions of a user with a sys- tem, as represented by the metadata generated during the ac- count creation and its subsequent use, can be used for iden- tiﬁcation. If this is true, and metadata can in fact represent us and as it is seldom if ever protected, it constitutes a risk for users’ privacy. Our goal is therefore, to determine if the information contained in users’ metadata is sufﬁcient to ﬁn- gerprint an account. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: • We develop and test strategies for user identiﬁcation through the analysis of metadata through state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, namely Multinomial Lo- gistic Regression (MLR) (Bishop 2001), Random For- est (RF) (Breiman 2001), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (Huang, Yang, and Chuang 2008). • We provide a performance evaluation of different classi- ﬁers for multi-class identiﬁcation problems, considering a variety of dimensions and in particular the characteristics of the training set used for the classiﬁcation task. • We assess the effectiveness of two obfuscation techniques in terms of their ability of hiding the identity of an account from which a message was posted. Motivation Formal Deﬁnition of the Study We consider a set of users U = {u1 , u2 , . . . , uk , . . . , uM }. Each user ui is characterized by a ﬁnite set of features Xuk = {xuk 1 , xuk 2 , . . . , xuk R }. In other words, we consider M users and each user is repre- sented by means of R features. Our goal is to map this set of users to a set of identities I = {i1 , i2 , . . . , ik , . . . , iM }. We assume that each user uk maps to a unique identity il . Identiﬁcation is framed in terms of a classiﬁcation prob- lem: in the training phase, we build a model with a known dataset; in our case, we consider a dataset in which a user uk as characterized by features Xuk , extracted from the user’s proﬁle, is assigned an identity il . Then, in the classiﬁcation phase, we assign to each user ˆuk , for which we assume that the identity is unknown, a set of probabilities over all the possible identities. More formally, for each user ˆuk (i.e., our test observation) the output of the model is a vector of the form PI ( ˆuk ) = {pi1 ( ˆuk ), pi2 ( ˆuk ), . . . , piM ( ˆuk )}, il∈I pil ( ˆuk ) = 1. Fi- where pi1 ( ˆuk ) is the probability that the test observation re- assigned to users in I, and therefore, (cid:80) lated to ˆuk will be assigned to identity i1 and so on. We assume a closed system where all the observations will be nally, the identity assigned to the observation will be the one that corresponds to argmaxil {pil ( ˆuk )}. Two users with features having the same values are indis- tinguishable. Moreover, we would like to point out that the values of each feature can be static (constant) over time or dynamic (variable) over time. An example of static feature is the account creation time. An example of dynamic feature is the number of followers of the user at the time the tweet was posted. Please also note that, from a practical point of view, our objective is to ascertain the identity of a user in the test set. In the case of a malicious user, whose identity has been modiﬁed over time, we assume that the ‘real’ identity is the one that is found in the training set. In this way, our method could also be used to group users with very similar characteristics and perhaps conclude that they belong to the same identity. Attack Model The goal of the study is to understand if it is possible to correctly identify an account given a series of features ex- tracted from the available metadata. In our evaluation, as discussed before, the input of the classiﬁer is a set of new (unseen) tweets. We refer to a successful prediction of the account identity as a hit and an unsuccessful one as a miss. We assume that the attacker is able to access the metadata of tweets from a group of users together with their identities (i.e., the training set); and, that the new tweets belong to one of the users in the training set. We present the likelihood of success of an identiﬁcation attack where the adversary’s ultimate goal is to identify a user from a set given this knowledge about the set of ac- counts. To achieve this, we answer this question: Is it pos- sible to identify an individual from a set of metadata ﬁelds from a randomly selected set of Twitter user accounts? Table 1: Description of relevant data ﬁelds. Feature Description Account creation Favourites count Follower count Friend count Geo enabled Listed count Post time stamp Statuses count Veriﬁed UTC time stamp of the account creation time. The number of tweets that have been marked as ‘favorites’ of this account. The number of users that are following this account. The number of users this account is following.

The number of tweets posted by this account. (boolean) Indicates that Twitter has checked the identity of the user that owns this account. Methods Metadata and the case of Twitter We deﬁne metadata as the information available pertaining to a Twitter post. This is information that describes the con- text on which the post was shared. Apart from the 140 char- acter message, each tweet contains about 144 ﬁelds of meta- data. Each of these ﬁelds provides additional information about: the account from which it was posted; the post (e.g. time, number of views); other tweets contained within the message; various entities (e.g. hashtags, URLs, etc); and the information of any users directly mentioned in it. From these features (in this work we will use features, ﬁelds, inputs to refer to each of the characteristics available from the meta- data) we created combinations from a selection of 14 ﬁelds as a basis for the classiﬁers. Feature Selection Feature selection methods can be essentially grouped in three classes following the classiﬁcation proposed by Liu and Yu in (Liu and Yu 2005): the ﬁlter approach that ranks features based on some statistical characteristics of the pop- ulation; the wrapper approach that creates a rank based on metrics derived from the measurement algorithm; and a group of hybrid methods which combine the previous two approaches. In the same paper, the authors claim that the wrapper method is guaranteed to ﬁnd the optimal combina- tion of inputs for classiﬁcation based on the selected crite- ria. Three years later, in (Huang, Yang, and Chuang 2008), Huang et al. provided validation by experimentally show- ing that for classiﬁcation, the wrapper approach results in the best possible performance in terms of accuracy for each algorithm. From the three proposed, the only method that allows for fair comparison between different algorithms is the wrapper method. Since it guarantees optimal feature combination on a per algorithm basis, it eliminates any bias in the analysis due to poor selection. Ultimately, we conducted a compre- hensive stratiﬁed search over the feature space and obtained a ranking per level for each of the algorithms. Here, a level corresponds to the number of features used as input for the classiﬁer and we will use n to denote it. In the ﬁrst level, where n = 1 we looked at the predictive power of each of the 14 features individually; for n = 2 we looked at all combinations of pairs of features, and so on. We use the term combinations to describe any group of n un-ordered features throughout the paper. The features selected were those that describe the user ac- count and were not under direct control of the user with the exception of the account ID which was excluded as it was used as ground truth (i.e. label) of each observation. As an example, the ﬁeld describing the users’ proﬁle background color was not included in the feature list while number of friends and number of posts were. Table 1 contains a de- scription of the ﬁelds selected. Implementation of the Classiﬁers We consider three state-of-the-art classiﬁcation methods: Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) (Bishop 2001), Random Forest (RF) (Breiman 2001), and K-Nearest Neigh- bors (KNN) (Huang, Yang, and Chuang 2008). Each of these algorithms follow a different method to make the recom- mendation and they are all popular within the community. We use the implementation of the algorithms provided by sci-kit learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011), a Python library. The optimization of the internal parameters for each classi- ﬁer was conducted as a combination of best practices in the ﬁeld and experimental results in which we used the cross- validated grid search capability offered by scikit-learn. In summary, we calculated the value of the parameters for each classiﬁer as follows. For KNN, we consider the single clos- est value based on the Euclidean distance between the obser- vations; for RF, we chose entropy as the function to measure the effectiveness of the split of the data in a node; ﬁnally, for MLR, we selected the limited-memory implementation of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (LM-BFGS) op- timizer as the value to optimize (Liu and Nocedal 1989). Obfuscation and Re-Identiﬁcation Obfuscation can only be understood in the context of data sharing. The goal of obfuscation is to protect the private indi- vidual ﬁelds of a dataset by providing only the result of some function computed over these ﬁelds (Mowbray, Pearson, and Shen 2012). To succeed, the possibilities are either to ob- fuscate the data or develop algorithms that protect it (Malik, Ghazi, and Ali 2012). We reasoned that an attacker will have access to any number of publicly available algorithms, this is outside of our control. However, we could manipulate the Table 2: KNN classiﬁcation accuracy using ten observations per user of two features follower count and friend count for input. We ran each experiment for an increasing number of users u. u 10 100 1,000 10,000 100,000 top result 94.283 (±0.696) 86.146 (±0.316) 70.348 (±0.112) 47.639 (±0.039) 28.091 (±0.089) top 5 98.933 (±0.255) 96.770 (±0.143) 90.867 (±0.076) 76.071 (±0.029) 55.438 (±0.192) granularity of the information made available. Our task is to determine whether doing so is an effective way of protect- ing user privacy, particularly when obfuscated metadata is released. In this work we focus on two classic obfuscation meth- ods: data randomization and data anonymization (Agrawal and Srikant 2000; Bakken et al. 2004; Polat and Du 2003). Data anonymization is the process by which the values of a column are grouped into categories and each reading is re- placed by an index of its corresponding category. Data ran- domization, on the other hand, is a technique that alters the values of a subset of the data points in each column accord- ing to some pre-determined function. We use rounding as the function to be applied to the data points. For each of the values that were altered, we rounded to one less than the most signiﬁcant value (i.e., 1,592 would be 1,600 while 31 would be 30). We measured the level of protection awarded by randomization by recording the accuracy of the predic- tions as we increased the number of obfuscated data points in increments of 10% until we reached full anonymization (i.e. 100% randomization) of the training set. Inference Methods Statistical inference is the process by which we general- ize from a sample a characteristic of the population. Boot- strapping is a computational method that allows us to make inferences without making any assumptions about the dis- tribution of the data and without the need of formulas to describe the sampling process. With bootstrapping we as- sume that each sample is the population and then aggre- gate the result from a large number of runs (anywhere be- tween 50 and 1,000 times depending on the statistic being drawn) (Mooney and Duval 1993). In this study we are pri- marily interested in the precision and accuracy of each clas- siﬁer as a measure of their ability to predict the correct user given a tweet. The results we present in the paper are an average over 200 repetitions of each experiment. In each ex- periment, the input data was randomly split between training and testing sets using a 7:3 proportion, which is a typical set- ting in evaluation of machine learning algorithms. Figure 1: Change in accuracy for a single feature combination and increasing users. Experimental Settings Dataset For data collection, we used the Twitter Streaming Public API (Twitter, Inc. 2018). Our population is a random1 sam- ple of the tweets posted between October 2015 and January 2016 (inclusive). During this period we collected approxi- mately 151,215,987 tweets corresponding 11,668,319 users. However, for the results presented here we considered only users for which we collected more than 200 tweets. Our ﬁnal dataset contains tweets generated by 5,412,693 users. Ethics Considerations Twitter is the perfect medium for this work. On one hand, users posting on Twitter have a very low expectation of pri- vacy: it is in the nature of the platform to be open and to reach the widest audience possible. Tweets must always be associated with a valid account and, since the company does not collect demographic information about users upon reg- istration, the accounts are not inherently linked to the phys- ical identity of the users. Both these factors reduce but not eliminate any ethical concerns that may arise from this work. Nonetheless, we submitted this project for IRB approval and proceeded with their support. Experimental Variables Number of Users As an attack, guessing is only viable for smaller user pools: indeed, there is a 1:10 probability of ran- domly classifying a tweet correctly for a user pool made up of 10 users, whereas there is a 1:10,000 probability in a pool of 10,000 users. The likelihood of guessing correctly is in- versely proportional to the number of users. Therefore, the ﬁrst task was to compare and describe the way in which in- creasing the number of users affects the accuracy of the clas- siﬁers. We evaluate each algorithm (i.e., MLR, RF, KNN) on a speciﬁc conﬁguration of training data in order to obtain a 1 It is worth noting that since we use the public Twitter API we do not have control on the sampling process. Having said that, an attacker will most probably access the same type of information. A typical use case is the release of data set of tweets usually obtained in the same way. 4060801001e+011e+021e+031e+041e+05Number of Users per SampleMean AccuracyResultstoptop5 trained model. We trained models for all feature combina- tions however, we present only the results for the best com- bination of parameters for each classiﬁer. We ﬁrst analyze the impact of the number of classes. In Figure 1 we present with ﬁxed parameters the effect of in- creasing only the number of outputs for each of the clas- siﬁers. Each model was built with two input features (i.e. n = 2 where the features are number of friends and num- ber of followers) and 10 observations per user. Some of the results we present are independent of the underlying clas- siﬁcation algorithm. For these instances, we present results using only KNN. As will be shown later in the paper, KNN shows the best performance in terms of prediction and re- source consumption. Figure 1 shows that the loss in accuracy is at worst linear. In a group of 100,000 users, the number of friends and of followers was sufﬁcient to identify 30% of the users (around 30,000 times better than random). However, while the accu- racy of the classiﬁcation gradually declines, there is a dra- matic increase in the cost (in terms of time) when building the model. As we will discuss in the last part of the Results section, the greatest obstacle with multi-class classiﬁcation is the number of classes included in the model. Number of Entries per User The next variable we con- sider is the number of observations per user per model. Our objective is to visualize the relationship between accuracy and the number of tweets to set a minimum value for the rest of the study. To set this parameter, we ﬁxed the number of input fea- tures at n = 2 and u = 1, 000 then we ran models with 10, 100, 200, 300, and 400 tweets per user. Figure 2 shows the aggregated results for the 20% most accurate feature combi- nations over 400 iterations. As the ﬁgure shows, ten entries is not enough to build robust models. For all classiﬁers we see that the behavior is almost asymptotic. There is a sig- niﬁcant increase in accuracy as the number of observations per user reaches 100. However, for all subsequent observa- tions, the variation is less apparent. Each of the points in the graph contains the conﬁdence interval associated with the measurement however, for RF the largest error is 0.2. It is worth noting that given the number of observations per user needed for robustness, with our data set we could only scale as far as 10,000 users. Using the bootstrapping method for inferences, going for- ward, we repeated each experiment 200 times. Each time with different conﬁgurations in terms of users and observa- tions (i.e. tweets) per user. By standardizing the number of observations per user at 200 tweets, we preempt two prob- lems: ﬁrst, by forcing all users to have the same number of tweets we reduce the likelihood of any user not having some entries in the training set; and second, it prevents our results from being biased towards any user with a disproportionate number of observations. This might be considered as poten- tially artiﬁcial, but we believe it represents a realistic base- line for evaluating this attack.

We deﬁne accuracy as the correct assignment of an obser- vation to a user. In a multi-class algorithm, the predicted re- sult for each observation is a vector containing the likelihood of that observation belonging to each of the users present in the model. A prediction is considered correct if the user as- signed by the algorithm corresponds to the true account ID. In the rest of the paper, we report aggregated results with 95% conﬁdence intervals. In our analysis, the account creation time was found to be highly discriminative between users. We present results with the dynamic features, deﬁned below, then we present our ﬁndings with the account creation time, and ﬁnally, we give a comprehensive analysis of the task of identiﬁcation given combinations of both static and dynamic features for three different classiﬁers.

Each time stamp is composed of six ﬁelds: day, month, year, hour, minute, and second of the account creation. For perfect classiﬁcation (i.e., uniqueness), we look for a variable whose value is constant within a class but distinct across classes (as explained before, each user in is a class). The account creation time is the very example of one such variable. We tested the full ACT using KNN and found that, even for 10,000 users, classifying on this feature resulted in 99.98% accuracy considering 200 runs. Nonetheless, the ACT is particularly interesting because while it represents one unique moment in time (and thus inﬁnite and highly en- tropic), it is composed of periodic ﬁelds with a limited range of possible values. As we see in Table 3 individually, each of the ﬁelds has at least a 75% drop in entropy as compared to the combined ACT. Since full knowledge of the ACT can be considered as the trivial case for our classiﬁcation problem, in the following sections we will consider the contribution of each ﬁeld of the ACT separately. u n features 10,000 1,000 100 10 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 day, minute, second follower, friend count friend count listed count, minute, second friend, listed count friend count month, minute, second minute, second friend count month, minute, second month, minute friend count accuracy(%) 96.737(±0.019) 83.719(±0.021) 14.612(±0.036) 99.648(±0.022) 92.809(±0.050) 40.151(±0.089) (±0.000) 100.00 98.836(±0.101) 78.650(±0.330) (±0.000) (±0.000) 100.00 96.428(±0.312) 100.00 Table 7: Accuracy of the top combination for n number of inputs for the RF classiﬁer. u n features 10,000 1,000 100 10 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 listed count, day, second friend count, minute friend count friend count, minute, second friend count, second friend count day, minute, second friend count, minute friend count day, minute, second day, second friend count accuracy(%) 94.234(±0.022) 81.352(±0.347) 23.958(±0.089) 99.881(±0.008) 97.28(±0.032) 49.538(±0.086) 100.00 (±0.000) 99.595(±0.023) 81.489(±0.299) 100.00 (±0.000) 100.00 (±0.000) 96.858(±0.256) Dynamic Attributes By dynamic attributes we mean all those attributes that are likely to change over time. From Table 1 these are the counts for: friends, followers, lists, sta- tuses, and favorites, as well as, a categorical representation of the time stamp based on the hour of each post. Table 4 presents the two best performing combinations in terms of accuracy for each of the values we consider for n and u. In 10,000 users there is a 92% chance of ﬁnding the correct account given the number of friends, followers and the number of times an account has been listed. Table 5 presents similar results for the RF algorithm. Even without the ACT, we are able to achieve 94.41% accuracy in a group of 10,000 users. These results are directly linked to the behavior of an account and are obtained from a multi- class model. Combining Static and Dynamic Attributes As we ex- pected from our feature selection, the top combinations per value of n inputs are different per classiﬁer. Tables 6, 7, 8 show the accuracy and the error obtained for the best per- forming pair of features aggregated over all runs for the three classiﬁers. We can see that the least accurate predictions are those derived by means of the MLR algorithm. Then, proba- bly for its robustness against noise, RF performs best for the smaller user-groups, but it is KNN that has the upper hand for the case where u = 10, 000. In general, the classiﬁcation task gets incrementally more challenging as the number of users increase.

If we consider the 10 most likely output candidates (i.e. the top-10 classes), for the 10,000 user group there is a 99.22% probability of ﬁnding the user. Finally, we looked at how the best performing combina- tions across all algorithms behaved in models for each clas- siﬁer. The top three combinations per value of n are pre- sented in Figures 6, 7, 8. For the same value of u as we increase n the accuracy increases. Obfuscation The ﬁnal analysis looks at the effects of data anonymization and data randomization techniques on the proposed method- ology. As we state in the Method section we start with the original data set then apply a rounding algorithm to change the values of each reading. The number of readings that pass through the algorithm increase in steps of 10% from no anonymization to 100% perturbation where we show full randomization. To test obfuscation, we selected the 3 most accurate combinations of features for n = 2 and u = 1, 000 for each of the classiﬁcation methods. While we are not working with geospatial data, we ﬁnd that similar to (Quan, Yin, and Guo 2015) the level of pro- tection awarded by perturbation is not very signiﬁcant until we get to 100% randomization. Figures 9, 10, and 11 show how each algorithm performs with an increasing number of obfuscated points. RF is the best performing, all three com- binations stay stable for a longer period of time and gives the best result with data anonymity. MLR is the most sensitive of the three. Even with 20% randomization there is a steep decrease in terms of prediction accuracy. Execution Time To compare the performance of the classiﬁers in terms of ex- ecution time we used a dedicated server with eight core Intel Xeon E5-2630 processors with 192GB DDR4 RAM running at 2,133MHz. For the implementation of the algorithms, we used Python 2.7 and Sci-kit learn release 0.17.1. Figure 12 shows execution time as a function of the num- ber of output classes in each model. Note that the perfor- mance gap between MLR and the other two is signiﬁcant. While KNN and RF show a linear increase over the number of users, the rate of change for MLR is much more rapid. At u = 1, 000 and n = 3, for example, MLR is 105 times slower than RF and 210 times slower than KNN. The perfor- mance bottleneck for multi-class classiﬁers is the number of output classes. Finding a viable solution is fundamental for this project and for the general applicability of the method. To address this, we implemented a divide and conquer al- gorithm where we get intermediate predictions over smaller subsets of classes and build one ﬁnal model with the (inter- mediate) results. This method allows for faster execution and lower memory requirements for each model and parallel ex- ecution resulting in further performance enhancements. Fig- ure 13 shows the effectiveness of the proposed method for u = 100, 1000, and 10000. We also observe that the accu- racy is independent from the number of subsets. Discussion and Limitations In this paper we have presented a comparison of three clas- siﬁcation methods in terms of accuracy and execution time. We reported their performance with and without input ob- fuscation. Overall, KNN provides the best trade-off in terms of accuracy and execution time with both the original and the obfuscated data sets. We tested each of the algorithms following the wrapper method by increasing the number of input features in each model in steps of one. The results, summarized in Tables 6, 7 and 8, show that the metadata can be effectively exploited to classify individuals inside a group of 10,000 randomly selected Twitter users. While both KNN and RF are similar in terms of accuracy and execution, MLR is consistently outperformed. Moreover, as shown in Figures 3, 4, and 5, as the number of output classes increases, the difference in performance becomes more apparent. It is also important to note that, as shown in Table 8, the accuracy ex- hibited by MLR depends entirely on the six constituent fea- tures of the account creation time. Finally, the performance of MLR is the most sensitive to obfuscation as shown in Fig- ure 11 the rounding algorithm results in a monotonic drop in accuracy for the best performing combinations. One of the challenges in this work was the scalability of the classiﬁcation algorithms. A key challenge in design- ing this type of algorithm is performance in terms of the scalability of its parameters. We found that while both the number of input features and the number of output classes have a detrimental impact on performance, the bottleneck can be identiﬁed in the latter. To address this we designed an ensemble-like algorithm that subsets the total number of users considered and creates smaller trained models us- ing fewer output classes and then, combine them. Figure 13 shows that the results obtained from this method are reli- able. We ran comparisons for u = 100, 1000, and 10000 using KNN and found that the precision and the recall of each model are equivalent to the ones obtained from a single model. This proves the scalabiliy of the proposed approach beyond the number of users available in our test data set. Figure 3: Overall accuracy u = 100. Figure 4: Overall accuracy u = 1, 000.

If an at- tacker is able to either trace an entry to an account, or an account to a user, that attacker gains information and the user loses of privacy. With regards to online social networks, the risks to privacy presented in (Alterman 2003) are magni- ﬁed when considering the temporal dimension. In contrast, the privacy controls that have been introduced are incom- plete. Studies have shown that often times these controls are lacking in terms of safeguarding against a dedicated ad- versary (Narayanan and Shmatikov 2009) but most impor- tantly, they are difﬁcult to use and are yet to be adopted by the majority of users (Bonneau, Anderson, and Church 2009). This results in a wealth of information about users openly available on the web. Primary personal data might be anonymized, but little attention has been devoted to meta- data. This paper shows the privacy risks associated to meta- data in terms of user identiﬁcation, showing that obfuscation is often insufﬁcient to protect users or the trade-off between obfuscation and utility of the data might not be acceptable. Identiﬁcation of Individuals Various identiﬁcation methods have been developed to ex- ploit existing information about physical attributes, behavior and choices of a user. For example, in (Patel et al. 2016) the authors describe an active authentication system that uses both physical and behavioral attributes to continuously mon- itor the identity of the user. In (Peacock, Ke, and Wilkerson 2004) the authors give an overview and present the advan- tages and disadvantages of keystroke characterization for au- thentication, identiﬁcation, and monitoring. Finally, in (Frey, Xu, and Ilic 2016) the authors use smartphone metadata, namely the apps that have been installed on a phone, to cre- ate a signature achieving a 99.75% accuracy. In this work, for the ﬁrst time we present an in-depth analysis of the risks associated to online social networks metadata. We would like to stress that metadata is more easily available and/or accessible and, for this reason, it represents a signiﬁcant risk for user privacy. Identiﬁcation of Devices Finally, another related and relevant class of problem is the identiﬁcation of devices. For example, in (Quattrone et al. 2014) the authors use phone diagnostics, i.e., information such as hardware statistics and system settings, to uniquely identify devices. Instead, the method presented in (Kohno, Broido, and Claffy 2005) relies on small but measurable differences of a device’s hardware clock. In (Bojinov et al. 2014) the authors exploit some characteristics of hardware components, in this case the accelerometer, the microphone and the speaker to create a ﬁngerprint without consent or knowledge of users. This is information about the sensors and not the measurements collected with them: for this rea- 406080100123Number of Input VariablesPrediction AccuracyclassifierKNNLOGITRF0255075100123Number of Input VariablesPrediction AccuracyclassifierKNNLOGITRF0255075100123Number of Input VariablesPrediction AccuracyclassifierKNNLOGITRF0204060friend_countminutesecondCombinationAccuracyClassifierKNNLOGITRF0255075100day,minuteday,secondminute,secondCombinationAccuracyClassifierKNNLOGITRF0255075100day, min, secday, month, secmonth, min, secCombinationAccuracyClassifierKNNLOGITRF Figure 9: KNN Change in predictive accuracy with obfuscated training data.

Conclusions In this paper, we have used Twitter as a case study to quan- tify the uniqueness of the association between metadata and user identity, devising techniques for user identiﬁcation and related obfuscation strategies. We have tested the perfor- mance of three state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, MLR, KNN and RF using a corpus of 5 million Twitter users. KNN provides the best performance in terms of ac- curacy for an increasing number of users and obfuscated data. We demonstrated that through this algorithm, we are able to identify 1 user in a group of 10,000 with approxi- mately 96.7% accuracy. Moreover, if we broaden the scope of our search and consider the best 10 candidates from a group of 10,000 users, we achieve a 99.22% accuracy. We also demonstrated that obfuscation strategies are ineffective: after perturbing 60% of the training data, it is possible to classify users with an accuracy greater than 95%. We believe that this work will contribute to raising aware- ness of the privacy risks associated to metadata. It is worth underlining that, even if we focused on Twitter for the exper- imental evaluation, the methods described in this work can be applied to a vast class of platforms and systems that gen- erate metadata with similar characteristics. This problem is particularly relevant given the increasing number of organi- zations that release open data with metadata associated to it or the popularity of social platforms that offer APIs to access their data, which is often accompanied by metadata.

Language is a human construction and has not kept up with our scientific revelation. Which is why theoretical physicists sometimes seem to be speaking another language.

They worried about the cycle of sunshine and darkness. But that cycle is different in every single village, town, and city on the planet. The cycle varies both east to west and north to south. And back when we used to spend our lives in our little village we didn’t care. But then the scientists and engineers invented trains to take us from one village to the next. And people needed to know when the train left their village. But how can you develop a timetable when every village has its own time? You can’t. But, at the same time, it’s not quite practical to say that the whole world has just one time. Farmers don’t care what the sun is doing in London. They care what it’s doing on their farm. (China actually has no time zones by edict. The entire country is on Beijing time and there are significant practical limitations.) The solution was the time zone, and it’s a compromise.

      "Prior to departure, China Aerospace had spent morethan three months training its security team in everything from counter surveillance to dealing with explosives.

      "“There is a perception among Chinese companies that they are high-level targets in One Belt, One Road countries,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That perception is driven by the media, like the tragedy of the two Chinese who were killed in Pakistan, and other incidents over the past few years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem, he said, is that Chinese businesses often mistake Beijing’s good diplomatic ties with a host country as an assurance of their workers’ safety on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In many cases, companies underestimate the real risks they face,” he said. “They look at the cost of security services and just hope they get lucky. They think ‘why should we spend money when the government [of the host country] welcomes our project?’”\n",

      "Over the past few months, not one, not two, but five different backdoors joined the list of security flaws in Cisco routers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cisco Architecture for Lawful Intercept\n",
      "\n",
      "Way back in 2004, Cisco wrote an IETF proposal for a “lawful intercept” backdoor for routers, which law enforcement could use to remotely log in to routers. Years later, in 2010, an IBM security researcher showed how this protocol could be abused by malicious attackers to take over Cisco IOS routers, which are typically sold to ISPs and other large enterprises.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Attackers could exploit these backdoors and not leave any audit trail. That’s how the lawful intercept protocol was designed so that ISP employees can’t tell when a law enforcement agent logs to the ISP’s routers (even though law enforcement is supposed to gain this access with a court order or other legal access request).\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, this protocol could be abused by ISP employees because no one else working for the ISP could then tell when someone gained access to the routers via Cisco’s Architecture for Lawful Intercept.\n",
      "\n",
      "New “Undocumented Backdoors” Appear\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2013, revelations made by German paper Der Spiegel showed that the NSA was taking advantage of certain backdoors in Cisco’s routers. Cisco denied accusations that it was working with the NSA to implement these backdoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2014, a new undocumented backdoor was found in Cisco’s routers for small businesses, which could allow attackers to access user credentials and issue arbitrary commands with escalated privileges.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2015, a group of state-sponsored attackers started installing a malicious backdoor in Cisco’s routers by taking advantage of many of the routers that kept the default administrative credentials, instead of changing them to something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, Cisco, with help from a Wikileaks data leak, discovered a vulnerability in its own routers that allowed the CIA to remotely command over 300 of Cisco’s switch models via a hardware vulnerability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five New Backdoors In Five Months\n",
      "\n",
      "This year has brought five undocumented backdoors in Cisco’s routers so far, and it isn't over yet. In March, a hardcoded account with the username “cisco” was revealed. The backdoor would have allowed attackers to access over 8.5 million Cisco routers and switches remotely.\n",
      "\n",
      "That same month, another hardcoded password was found for Cisco's Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP) software, which is used for remote installation of Cisco’s video and voice products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later this May, Cisco found another undocumented backdoor account in Cisco’s Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center, used by enterprises for the provisioning of devices across a network.\n",
      "\n",
      "In June, yet another backdoor account was found in Cisco’s Cisco’s Wide Area Application Services (WAAS), a software tool for Wide Area Network (WAN) traffic optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most recent backdoor was found in the Cisco Policy Suite, a software suite for ISPs and large companies that can manage a network’s bandwidth policies. The backdoor gives an attacker root access to the network and there are no mitigations against it, other than patching the software with Cisco’s update.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether or not the backdoor accounts were created in error, Cisco will need to put an end to them before this lack of care for security starts to affect its business.\n",

      "When Google introduced Google Duplex, its AI assistant designed to speak like a human, the company showed off how the average person could use the tech to save time making reservations and whatnot. What wasn’t touched on was the possibility that Duplex may have a use on the other side of the line, taking over for call center employees and telemarketers.\n",
      "\n",
      "A report from The Information suggests Google may be making a play to find other applications for its human-sounding assistant and has already started experimenting with ways to use Duplex to do with away roles currently filled by humans—a move that could have ramifications for millions of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Citing a person familiar with Google’s plans, The Information reported the company is already in conversation with at least one potential customer that would like to integrate Duplex into its operations. That firm, an unnamed large insurance company, is reportedly interested in using the voice assistant to handle simple, straightforward customer service calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesperson for Google told Gizmodo the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re currently focused on consumer use cases for the Duplex technology where we can help people get things done, rather than applying it to potential enterprise use cases. We aren’t testing Duplex with any enterprise clients. Duplex is designed to operate in very specific use cases, and currently we’re focused on testing with restaurant reservations, hair salon booking, and holiday hours with a limited set of trusted testers. It’s important that we get the experience right, and we’re taking a slow and measured approach as we incorporate learnings and feedback from our tests.\n",

      "If Google can find its way into the business of automated phone calls for companies, it could creep its way into a massive profit center. The research firm ResearchAndMarkets projects the cloud-based customer call center market will reach about $21 billion by 2022—up from $6.8 billion in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, as the market expands, so will the competition, and Google isn’t the only major tech firm that sees opportunity in entering call centers. Last year, Amazon started selling a version of its wildly popular voice assistant Alexa designed specifically for use responding to questions via phone and text. Companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Cisco also already have their foot in the door of this business, per The Information.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While there may be major profits awaiting these firms as the conquer call centers, they also come with a cost: humans will inevitably be bumped from the jobs. Most companies already outsource the work to countries where they can pay paltry wages in order to keep the expenses related to customer service down, and AI would likely cut those costs even more. That would be devastating for a nation like the Philippines, which has an estimated 1.2 million call-center workers according to the Wall Street Journal.\n",

      "Historically, one of the biggest obstacles to eliminating the human aspect of customer call interactions is the fact that the AI kinda sucks to deal with. A 2015 survey conducted by The Conversation found that the vast majority of people—90 percent of those questioned—call into customer service hoping to speak with a human. About eight in 10 said they speed through the automated portion with the intention of talking to a person, and just 10 percent reported being satisfied with so-called “interactive voice response systems.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Google Duplex may have a solution to that problem by making the automated interactions less robotic and more life-like. Google wowed people with its demo of Duplex that included the AI assistant inserting “um” and “uh” sounds to make the conversation seem more fluid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That may also have the complete opposite effect on people. Some folks found the Duplex demo was scary as hell and worried about the ethical concerns of AI basically faking people out by pretending to be human. Backlash eventually made Google promise that Duplex will tell people they are speaking with AI, but the company still has a way to go to ease everyone’s worries.\n",

Among other features, the company’s materials describe “person tracking” as an “easy and accurate” way to investigate and monitor people. Amazon says Rekognition can be used to identify “people of interest,” raising the possibility that those labeled suspicious by governments — such as undocumented immigrants or Black activists — will be seen as fair game for Rekognition surveillance. It also says Rekognition can monitor “all faces in group photos, crowded events, and public places such as airports,” at a time when Americans are joining public protests at unprecedented levels.\n",

      "Tell Amazon to get out of the surveillance business\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon not only markets Rekognition as a law enforcement service, it is helping governments deploy it. Amazon lists the city of Orlando, Florida, and the Washington County Sheriff’s Office in Oregon among its customers. Upon learning this, the ACLU Foundations of California coordinated with the ACLU of Oregon and the ACLU of Florida on public records requests to learn more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The documents we obtained indicate that the Washington County sheriff and the city of Orlando became Rekognition customers in 2017. Washington County has since built a database of at least 300,000 mugshot photos to use in coordination with Rekognition. It also built a mobile app for its deputies to quickly scan for a match against the county’s database by submitting images obtained from surveillance or other sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon is providing company resources to help government agencies deploy Rekognition. In emails between Amazon and Washington County employees, the company offers the expertise of the Rekognition product team, troubleshoots problems encountered by the county, and provides “best practices” advice on how to deploy the service. In what Orlando’s police chief praises as a “first-of-its-kind public-private partnership,” Amazon promised free consulting services to build a Rekognition “proof of concept” for the city. Rekognition face surveillance is now operating across Orlando in real-time, according to Amazon, allowing the company to search for “people of interest” as footage rolls in from “cameras all over the city.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the records, Amazon also solicits feedback and ideas for “potential enhancements” to Rekognition’s capabilities for governments. Washington County even signed a non-disclosure agreement created by Amazon to get “insight into the Rekognition roadmap” and provide additional feedback about the product. The county later cited this NDA to justify withholding documents in response to the ACLU’s public records request.\n",
      "\n",
      "The documents also revealed that Amazon offered to connect Washington County with other Amazon government customers interested in Rekognition — as well as a body camera manufacturer. Indeed, Amazon’s promotional materials previously recommended that law enforcement use Rekognition to identify people in police body camera footage. The company removed mention of police body cameras from its site after the ACLU raised concerns in discussions with Amazon. That appears to be the extent of its response to our concerns. This and other profoundly troubling surveillance practices are still permissible under the company’s policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Rekognition, a government can now build a system to automate the identification and tracking of anyone. If police body cameras, for example, were outfitted with facial recognition, devices intended for officer transparency and accountability would further transform into surveillance machines aimed at the public. With this technology, police would be able to determine who attends protests. ICE could seek to continuously monitor immigrants as they embark on new lives. Cities might routinely track their own residents, whether they have reason to suspect criminal activity or not. As with other surveillance technologies, these systems are certain to be disproportionately aimed at minority communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of Rekognition’s capacity for abuse, we asked Washington County and Orlando for any records showing that their communities had been provided an opportunity to discuss the service before its acquisition. We also asked them about rules governing how the powerful surveillance system could be used and ensuring rights would be protected. Neither locality identified such records. In fact, Washington County began using Rekognition even as employees raised questions internally. In one email, a Washington County employee expressed the concern that the “ACLU might consider this the government getting in bed with big data.” That employee’s prediction was correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "People should be free to walk down the street without being watched by the government. By automating mass surveillance, facial recognition systems like Rekognition threaten this freedom, posing a particular threat to communities already unjustly targeted in the current political climate. Once powerful surveillance systems like these are built and deployed, the harm will be extremely difficult to undo.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Rekognition is not reined in, its use is also certain to spread. The records we obtained show that law enforcement agencies in California and Arizona have contacted Washington County asking about Rekognition. So have multiple “fusion centers,” which collect information about people for dissemination across agencies at the local and federal level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon has publicly opposed secretive government surveillance. Its CEO, Jeff Bezos, has himself criticized Trump administration’s discriminatory Muslim ban. But actions speak louder than words, and Amazon’s efforts to deploy this technology run counter to its proclaimed values and risk harm to the company’s customers and their communities.\n",

      "Polar, a fitness app, is revealing the homes and lives of people exercising in secretive locations, such as intelligence agencies, military bases and airfields, nuclear weapons storage sites, and embassies around the world, a joint investigation of Bellingcat and Dutch journalism platform De Correspondent reveals.\n",
      "\n",
      "In January Nathan Ruser discovered that the fitness app Strava revealed sensitive locations throughout the world as it tracked and published the exercises of individuals, including soldiers at secret (or, “secret”) military outposts. The discovery of those military sites made headlines globally, but Polar, which can feed into the Strava app, is revealing even more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manufacturing company known for making the world’s first wireless heart-rate monitor uses its site ‘Polar Flow’ as a social platform where users can share their runs. Compared to the similar services of Garmin and Strava, Polar publicizes more data per user in a more accessible way, with potentially disastrous results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home is where the heart is\n",
      "\n",
      "By showing all the sessions of an individual combined onto a single map, Polar is not only revealing the heart rates, routes, dates, time, duration, and pace of exercises carried out by individuals at military sites, but also revealing the same information from what are likely their homes as well. Tracing all of this information is very simple through the site: find a military base, select an exercise published there to identify the attached profile, and see where else this person has exercised. As people tend to turn their fitness trackers on/off when leaving or entering their homes, they unwittingly mark their houses on the map. Users often use their full names in their profiles, accompanied by a profile picture — even if they did not connect their Facebook profile to their Polar account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polar is not the only app doing this, but the difference between it and other popular fitness platforms, such as Strava or Garmin, is that these other sites require you to navigate to a specific person to view separate instances of his or her sessions, each exercise having its own small map. Moreover, they often limit the number of exercises that can be viewed. Polar makes it far worse by showing all the exercises of an individual done since 2014, all over the world on a single map.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, you only need to navigate to an interesting site, select one of the profiles exercising there, and you can get a full history of that individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Know by heart\n",
      "\n",
      "With only a few clicks, a high-ranking officer of an airbase known to host nuclear weapons can be found jogging across the compound in the morning. From a house not too far from that base, he started and finished many more runs on early Sunday mornings. His favorite path is through a forest, but sometimes he starts and ends at a car park further away. The profile shows his full name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Activities normally shrouded in secrecy are laid bare with incredible detail. At a U.S. Air Force base where armed drones are stationed, an intelligence officer can be found exercising. Again, his name and profile picture openly available.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can find Western military personnel in Afghanistan through the Polar site. Cross-checking one name and profile picture with social media confirmed one soldier or officer’s identity. Polar showed his runs in several military bases spread throughout the Middle East, as well as the start and finish of dozens of exercises from a house in New York state. In early 2017, as the Polar app freely tells us, he made a trip to the west-side of the US and used a bike there. He also logged exercise from a hotel during a stay in Thailand. All this activity was accompanied with a time-stamp, his exact route, his heart-rate, and the amount of calories he burned.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can go through other military bases in the Middle East, Southern Asia, and Africa to find Western military servicemen and women and cross-reference their full names with social network profiles, including LinkedIn. A selection of individuals that we found on the Polar site who were identifiable from their public information, and whose homes we where able to locate includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "Military personnel exercising at bases known, or strongly suspected, to host nuclear weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individuals exercising at intelligence agencies, as well as embassies, their homes, and other locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Persons working at the FBI and NSA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Military personnel specialised in Cyber Security, IT, Missile Defence, Intelligence and other sensitive domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Persons serving on submarines, exercising at a submarine bases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individuals both from management and security working at nuclear power plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "A CEO of a manufacturing company, exercising in locations all over the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Americans in the Green Zone in Baghdad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Russian soldiers in Crimea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Military personnel at Guantanamo Bay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Troops stationed near the North Korean border.\n",
      "\n",
      "Airmen involved in the battle against the Islamic State.\n",
      "\n",
      "This list is not exhaustive. We were able to scrape Polar’s site (another security flaw) for individuals exercising at 200+ of such senstive sites, and we gathered a list of nearly 6,500 unique users. Together, these users had made over 650.000 exercises, marking the places they work, live, and go on vacation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The security implications are obviously grave. In countries where soldiers were banned from wearing their uniforms on the street in the off-chance that they would run into a potential terrorist, addresses and living patterns can now be found easily by anyone with internet access and the wits to use Polar’s site. In its current form, it is not difficult to find the time of deployment, home, photograph, and the function of a soldier in a conflict zone. It does not take much imagination to see how this information could be used in dangerous ways by extremists or state intelligence services. This is especially concerning considering the data we managed to gather on personnel at multiple nuclear weapons storage sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The risk from Polar’s open data set also poses a risk to civilians, as those with ill intentions could use Polar to see when, and for how long, users in an area tend to be away from their homes, as well as when they are abroad if they bring the heart rate sensors with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open Season\n",
      "\n",
      "On registering your account, Polar asks you to provide a name, location, height, weight, date of birth, gender and the amount of training per week. Though you can obviously fill in fake information, the majority of users we surveyed provided what seems to be reliable information. Along with the ability to connect your account to Facebook, Polar also offers integration with five other apps (including Strava) to share “all your sessions automatically”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with turning up the privacy settings, plenty of data will still be available. Here are some examples:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Changing the privacy from ‘Public’ to ‘Followers’ will still let profiles show a name, photo and the location they wrote in during registering to anyone. Users would also need to turn off the option that allows others to become a ‘Follower’ automatically if they want to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Changing the privacy of sessions, even to the most strict, only affects new sessions. Older sessions will remain visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other fitness sites, such as Strava, provide the option to automatically prevent your home or work-location from being published. Polar doesn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible to remove individual sessions, but many accounts appear to have hundreds of sessions logged, making it a very cumbersome process.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are sessions on the map which are completely private, not linked to anything else. However, once several of these private exercises starting and ending at the same home are located, it is still possible to gather information about when and where a person living there is going.\n",
      "\n",
      "User ID’s connected to “private” runs are easily retrievable, meaning it is still possible to connect exercises at different locations to one person.\n",
      "\n",
      "The privacy policy has been updated in August 2017, and new accounts do have their default settings set to the most private options available, meaning users have to opt-in to share. In response to our research, Polar stated it recognized the sensitive nature of the data that was being revealed, and decided to temporarily suspend the ‘explore’ function. Polar is also now working on other solutions to these issues, such as adding the ability to remove the exercise history in one go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawbacks\n",
      "\n",
      "As with most open sources, Polar’s platform has its limitations. The Polar data relies on GPS, which can be inaccurate and spoofed, as Bellingcat described in an article on how to use Strava data. Moreover, users can (and probably should) turn their sensors on/off some distance from their homes. However, this is mostly negated by the fact that after multiple exercises, start- and end-points usually do average out to one particular residence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data tends to be accurate enough to tell when users are on the street, or on the property of a particular house. It becomes more difficult when dealing with dense cities and apartment buildings, though most fitness trackers seem to track elevation fairly accurately. In one instance, we tracked an individual working at a senstive location back to an appartment building. This person often started running in front of the building on the ground, but also had occasionally started an exercise at a much higher altitude. The difference between those two heights, combined with the coordinates, matched an exact floor within the apartment building.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Heart of the Matter\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding the names and even addresses of soldiers online is in itself not new. The amount of data people are (unknowingly) putting online has long raised concerns with both the public and with governments. Separate social media accounts, posts, and information can be pieced together to provide a fairly complete picture about an individual. As seen in hundreds of articles on Bellingcat and other open source-focused sites, images and videos reveal a lot of information and can be used in geolocation to provide additional context. What is new is how easy it has become to track individuals using fitness apps such as Strava, and especially with the scale and speed of Polar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. military has already reviewed its rules for fitness trackers, and it is likely other countries will have done so too. However, it was still possible to identify plenty of American users at many military locations. It is also worth noting that this is only data from Polar heart rate monitors, while there is a whole world of tracking devices and apps out there. Chinese fitness apps, for example, are already used by hundreds of millions and are sponsored by the government, which aims to develop ”a variety of fitness activities and special sports items”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fitness devices and apps are just one more area where people need to be aware of what kind of data they are sharing, particularly as they strongly rely on sensitive data such as location and health-metrics. As always, check your app-permissions, try to anonymize your online presence, and, if you still insist on tracking your activities, start and end sessions in a public space, not at your front door. Finally, if you want absolute assurance that you are not running into data-pitfalls during future exercises, you could leave your device at home, so you can jog around anonymously to your heart’s content.\n",

      "Malicious hackers are mass exploiting a critical vulnerability in D-Link DSL routers in an attempt to make them part of Satori, the potent Internet-of-things botnet that is used to take down websites and mine digital coins, researchers said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a better mousetrap\n",
      "\n",
      "Since making its debut late last year, Satori has proven to be a particularly versatile and sophisticated botnet. It made a name for itself in December when it infected more than 100,000 Internet-connected devices in just 12 hours by exploiting remote code-execution vulnerabilities in Huawei and RealTek routers. A month later, Satori operators released a new version that infected devices used to mine digital coins , proving that the IoT botnet could also take control of more traditional computing devices. In February, Satori resurfaced when it infected tens of thousands of routers manufactured by Dasan Networks\n",
      "\n",
      "A key to Satori’s success is its use of the publicly released Mirai IoT botnet source code to turn devices with easily guessable passwords into platforms for launching Internet-crippling attacks. In 2016, Mirai launched a series of record-setting denial-of-service attacks that took security site KrebsonSecurity offline and also targeted online gamers. Satori operators use the Mirai code as a foundation on which they’ve erected an evolving series of new exploits that allow the botnet to control devices even when they’re secured with strong passwords.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past five days, researchers said, Satori has started mass exploiting a critical vulnerability in the D-Link DSL 2750B, a combination router and DSL modem that’s used by subscribers of Verizon and other ISPs. Attack code exploiting the two-year-old remote code-execution vulnerability was published last month, although Satori’s customized payload delivers a worm. That means infections can spread from device to device with no end-user interaction required. D-Link’s website doesn’t show a patch being available for the unindexed vulnerability, and D-Link representatives didn’t respond to an email seeking comment for this post.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers with Netlab 360 first reported Satori was exploiting the D-Link vulnerability in a blog post published Friday. They also said Satori had started exploiting a vulnerability in a router made by XiongMai. On Tuesday, researchers from Radware reported seeing an “exponential increase in the number of attack sources” for attacks on both the D-Link and XiongMai devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Radware’s Threat Research team witnessed thousands of IPs trying to infect our honeypots at a high rate using a previously unseen payload,” the researchers wrote in a blog post. The attack, targeting the D-Link routers, causes them to send a wget command that downloads a remote script hosted on a webserver at 185.62.190.191. The US represented the fourth most-affected country, behind Brazil, the Republic of Korea, and Italy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radware said the vulnerability was disclosed no later than 2016. This D-Link page shows the most recent firmware version for the device was released in 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exploits come a month after researchers disclosed the existence of malware developed by Russian spies that has infected more than 500,000 routers from a variety of manufacturers. Dubbed VPNFilter, the malware isn’t believed to have any connection to Satori. Neither the D-Link DSL-2750B nor the XiongMai device is included on the list of routers known to be targeted by VPNFilter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not immediately clear what people with a vulnerable D-Link device can do to protect themselves from these attacks. Ars has asked both D-Link and Radware to provide guidance. In the meantime, people using one should strongly consider replacing it.\n",

Shortening that time can make the difference between spending a few thousand dollars on remediation and millions to deal with a full-on compromise. Yet many organizations still have not implemented hunt teams. That is evident when we consider that 38 percent of breaches are detected by a third party or external entity rather than the victim organization. To bring down that number, and lower the overall cost of security, we must assume that breaches have occurred and hunt for their evidence before damage occurs. I talk to organizations every day about threat hunting. Some think that threat hunting is taking known indicators of com- promise (IoCs) from threat intelligence feeds and searching for them. But while it is good to know if you are susceptible to previously discovered attacks, that is like driving down the road while looking only in the rearview mirror. Threat hunting involves hypothesizing about attackers’ behavior and verifying the hypotheses in your environment. For example, searching your organization for all remote access tools (RATs) from the past decade is not threat hunting. But you can uncover malicious activity by finding likely persistence locations on sys- tems across your enterprise and measuring how often certain items and certificate signers appear in them. Since I started in InfoSec, I have seen the pendulum swing between “We trust our security software to stop everything” and “I believe my security software will usually fail.” Neither opinion is wise. Threat hunting is the best way companies have to stop the damage and loss that occurs when we have to rely upon third parties to notify us that we have a problem.

How can you come to grips with threats that don’t use known malware or indicators of compromise? How can you deduce the presence of “fileless” attacks that leave no files or malicious tools on a hard drive? Don’t worry. If you are new to threat hunting, this guide will show you how to get started. We begin with an overview of threat hunting, then introduce techniques you can use today to stop unknown suspicious activity in your network. You will learn how to find ongoing attacks by proactively searching for signs of fileless attacks, persistence mechanisms, evidence of lateral movement, and credential theft. We include a guide to getting started with free and open source resources (Appendix A), and a cheat sheet to remind you of key information and hunt methods until they become second nature (Appendix B). Looking to go into depth? We discuss frameworks and tools for finding and analyzing different types of evidence. We also point you toward sources on the web where you can find in-depth discussions and regular updates on important topics. If this sounds interesting, please read on...

Chapter 1 Be the Hunter I n t h i s c h a p t e r Learn basic concepts about threat hunting Review the knowledge and experience hunt teams need Understand the kinds of indicators and behaviors that hunters search for In this chapter we introduce the concept of threat hunting and summarize some of the key ideas. By the end you will be ready to learn how to conduct hunts, the subject of the remain- ing six chapters of this guide. What Is Hunting? Most IT security activities are reactive. They focus on imple- menting security controls that detect attacker actions, then on responding when indicators of a threat are identified on the enterprise network. This is a central element of security. However, it is also an essentially defensive approach that leaves room for sophisticated adversaries to “dwell” undetected on the network for weeks, months, or even years: ample time to find and steal valuable data, or to disrupt business operations. In contrast, threat hunting is a proactive approach to securing your organization’s systems. It is the process of actively looking for signs of malicious activity within enterprise networks, with- out prior knowledge of those signs. It allows you to uncover threats on your network without signatures or known indica- tors of compromise (IOCs). In this guide we outline effective approaches to finding the 2 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting types of malicious activity that don’t trigger alerts or use the kind of malware you can catch with signatures. We also tell you where to begin looking for them. The primary goal The primary goal of threat hunting is to reduce dwell time. By finding compromises as early as possible, you can remove mali- cious activity from your systems and networks before attackers can accomplish their objectives. By detecting adversaries early in the intrusion, organizations also reduce the level of effort to scope and remediate, substantially lowering the cost of compromise. Human processes aided by technology Threat hunting relies primarily on human processes. Hunters apply the scientific method: defining a problem to be solved, stating a hypothesis to solve it, proposing a procedure to gather and analyze evidence, and measuring the result. Threat hunting also depends on knowing what to look for and where to look. Members of the hunt team must use their knowledge and experience, as well as this guide and other resources describing adversary tradecraft, to make those decisions. Technology does not drive hunting processes, but it is a critical enabler. Hunt-specific technology solutions allow hunters to capture, identify, correlate, enrich, measure, and analyze thou- sands of pieces of data needed to conduct effective and efficient hunts. The Hunt Team Responsibilities for threat hunting can be organized many ways. Smaller organizations typically make threat hunting a part- time job. Hunters may take turns hunting on a designated set of assets, and sometimes are responsible for remediation actions after compromises are discovered. Larger organizations often have full-time hunters, sometimes Chapter 1: Be the Hunter | 3 dozens of people distributed around the world, explicitly working as a dedicated hunt team. The hunt team is usually comprised of a team lead and several hunters. The hunt team focuses on quickly identifying the presence of advanced adver- saries and compromises and prioritizing their handling. It then hands off responsibility for incident response and remediation. Knowledge The hunt team needs people with a wide range of experience. It is essential to include people with knowledge of: ; ; ; ; Security - methods commonly used by adversaries, incident analysis and response techniques, and tools for detecting and analyzing attacks, malware, and other exploits. Threat detection - techniques and tools, including those typically used for red teaming and penetration testing, and those used by adversaries. IT operations - applications, networks, and enter- prise architectures, and the inner workings of the operating systems used by the organization’s assets. Communication – how to communicate effectively with other hunters and security professionals, system administrators, upper management, the legal team, and human resources staff. Roles Hunt teams should include people who can fulfil a variety of roles, including: ; Incident manager – a technical person who under- stands how each threat exposes the business to risk, and has the authority to direct the team to investi- gate and address signs of malicious activity. ; Response analyst – a person who can analyze data from one or more sources, then document and com- municate findings. 4 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting ; Malware analyst – a person who can use automated malware analysis tools to understand and reverse- engineer malware samples, and who can produce decoders and other utilities for response analysts. ; Operations staff – people with knowledge of system and network administration, application develop- ment, and other IT functions. TIP Membership on a hunt team can be a great way to learn new skills and explore new career directions. What Hunt Teams Look For You can’t find what you don’t look for (pardon our shaky grammar). What hunt teams look for is very different from the known malware samples and previously identified IOCs that occupy the time and attention of the security operations center (SOC). Hunt teams focus on uncovering behaviors and other evidence of attacker techniques and activities. We don’t mean to say that your hunt team should ignore “known bad” indicators such as file hashes, IP addresses, and DNS records. Instead, the team should create automated searches and queries to find them. Automated matching frees up your most precious asset: human beings. Treat the results of this matching process as alerts, triage them, and use the findings as input for your hunts. As a general practice, hunt team members should research the offensive tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of attackers in a threat-agnostic manner, documenting those that target the enterprise’s industry and geographical locations. Note that although techniques and tactics are sometimes treated as syn- onyms, you should think of techniques as aspects of a threat actor’s skill set, and tactics as applications of those techniques. TIP TIP Chapter 1: Be the Hunter | 5 DON’T FORGET Most organizations are targeted by more than one kind of adversary. Financially motivated actors, “hacktivists,” and state-sponsored operators each have different motivations, targets, and TTPs. Study all of those who might target your enterprise. Keep in mind that adversaries are not constrained in the ways defenders are, and some individuals operate in more than one threat category. Artifacts and indicators of behaviors As attackers interact with the environment, their behaviors produce artifacts that we can use to identify the intrusion. These artifacts come in several varieties, including but not limited to: Filesystem metadata ; Network metadata (such as NetFlow and DNS que- ries and responses) ; ; Application data and metadata ; User and authentication records For example, if a threat actor is using an Internet server application programming interface (ISAPI) filter of Microsoft’s Internet Information Services (IIS) to persist malware on a webserver, it might generate: ; One or more malicious files ; Modifications to the IIS configuration file ; User session artifacts in the registry and filesystem Authentication from remote access attempts ; Even if the threat actor took very few actions, those actions would leave behind a trail you can follow if you collect the right data and examine it regularly. This is an example of Locard’s exchange principle of forensic science. 6 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Locard’s Exchange Principle “Every contact leaves a trace” Dr. Edmond Locard (1877 – 1966). Restated by forensic scientist Paul L. Kirk as: “Wherever [the criminal] steps, whatever he touches, whatever he leaves, even unconsciously, will serve as a silent witness against him. Not only his fingerprints or his footprints, but his hair, the fibers from his clothes, the glass he breaks, the tool mark he leaves, the paint he scratches…All of these and more, bear mute witness against him. This is evidence that does not forget.” Traces of attacker tradecraft According to Merriam-Webster.com, tradecraft is “the tech- niques and procedures of espionage.” Most attackers, just like spies, have to follow one of a few general procedures in order to achieve their goals. If you know these general procedures, the attacker tradecraft, you can look for traces of those activities. Defenders should be aware that most of their adversaries attempt to take the following steps: Access a victim environment Create and maintain command and control (C2) communication between the attackers on the outside and software under their control on an internal system ; Obtain and leverage additional privileges ; ; ; ; ; ; ; Conduct reconnaissance of networks and hosts Identify data, applications, and systems of interest Access one or more systems Collect or destroy sensitive data Exfiltrate the data or otherwise achieve their objectives TECH TALK Chapter 1: Be the Hunter | 7 If we know that attackers are going to follow these steps, we can hunt in parts of the computing environment that would show traces of these actions. Let’s look at how you might hunt for evidence of attacker tradecraft. Suppose you suspect that a threat actor is using an ISAPI filter to persist malware on a web server. Because you have done research on this persistence technique, you know that it loads a malicious DLL when an adversary-defined file extension (like “.xcfGGj3kBks”) is requested from the web server. You could monitor IIS configuration files to detect mod- ifications that would indicate the use of this technique (of course, after you imposed software revision controls to ensure you could roll back to a known good state). You could also check the IIS logs, which might show the requests that triggered the malicious ISAPI filter execution or the processes spawned by the web server. In fact, you can baseline these log entries to streamline analysis. Intrusion attributes There are other characteristics of intrusion attempts that can tip you off to malicious activity. Advanced attacks often: Combine multiple discrete techniques ; Occur over relatively compressed time periods ; ; ; ; ; Include both benign and malicious executables Acquire and leverage some type of privileged access Involve one or more endpoints Change the contents of endpoint file systems Categorizing Unknowns One of the biggest challenges of threat hunting is that you are examining events and artifacts that are not inherently mali- cious or benign but might be either. However, there are several techniques you can use to point toward one side or the other. 8 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Prevalence You can make a good judgement about the likelihood that events and artifacts are related to attacks by measuring their prevalence, the frequency with which they occur in an environment. Sophisticated attacks usually only affect a relatively small num- ber of systems on the network. Therefore, events and artifacts that are scarce are more likely to be malicious than those that are more prevalent. For example, suppose you find a previously unknown binary file on 85 percent of your Windows systems. That is almost certainly benign software. It is unlikely that an attacker could plant malware on such a high percentage of your systems. On the other hand, an unknown binary file on 2 percent of your Windows systems could be the result of a successful phishing campaign. As a guideline, low prevalence is more suspicious than high prevalence. There are rare cases of widespread outbreaks that leave evi- dence on hundreds of systems. However, these exceptions to the rule are usually obvious, such as ransomware. Recentness Recentness is another analytic that enables analysts to make judgement calls, by grouping events and artifacts into the new- est and the oldest. Since the attacks you need to worry about most are the ones still going on, recent occurrences are more likely to be malicious than older ones. For example, an unknown binary file that appeared on endpoints three days ago is more likely to represent an ongo- ing threat than one that was last installed three years ago. Likewise, a registry setting that hasn’t been changed in two years is less suspicious than one changed two days ago. Patterns of behavior There are many actions and behaviors that appear innocuous when considered individually, but can show patterns across an enterprise that indicate malicious intent. Chapter 1: Be the Hunter | 9 For example, endpoints on the network establish connections with servers on the Internet all the time. However, when an endpoint establishes connections with an unknown server at regularly scheduled intervals, it is a tip-off that malware might be “phoning home” to a server controlled by attackers. In the same way, logons succeed and fail every second of every day, but logons from invalid or disabled user accounts are suspicious. Anomalies Departures from standard behaviors can also help you catego- rize unknown events and artifacts. The types of deviations that merit investigation include: ; Unusual volumes and frequencies (uploading 10GB to an external website in under 24 hours; 20 failed logon attempts per minute from one endpoint) ; Deviations from a standard configuration (execut- able files that do not appear on the golden image; differences in registry keys between newly created systems and systems that have been present in the environment for months) ; Departures from convention (host and file names that do not follow the organization’s naming conventions) Other places to hunt for anomalies include: ; Run and RunOnce keys ; Windows services ; Registered COM servers ; ; Image file execution options Application debuggers 10 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Building Environmental Awareness Before your team can start threat hunting for unusual patterns of behavior and anomalies, it needs to build awareness of its environment, determine expected activities, and create base- lines. You need to find the answers to questions like these: ; How do our system administrators interact with servers, and from where? ; Which accounts have membership in privileged groups, and which ones? ; What remote execution tools are commonly used in this environment? ; Which UserAgent strings are common here? ; Where are the most sensitive pieces of data stored, and how do users normally access that data? ; What are typical levels of server-to-workstation, server-to-browser, and workstation-to-server lateral movement?

Chapter 2 Structuring Hunts I n t h i s c h a p t e r See suggestions for selecting an attack lifecycle framework Learn how to structure a hunt process in six steps Understand dif ferent types of metrics for assessing your hunts Although you can take an unstructured approach here and there, for most of your threat hunting activities you should establish some structure. Defining a process for each hunt helps make the steps repeatable. This makes it easier to measure outcomes and assess the performance of your tools and your team’s methods. It also enables you to present find- ings to management in a consistent manner across hunts. The best approach to defining a hunt process is to apply the scientific method: ; ; State the problem to be solved and a hypothesis for solving it Propose a procedure to gather and analyze evidence ; Define metrics to evaluate the success of the effort Selecting a Framework Before defining individual hunts, it is useful to select an attack lifecycle framework that breaks down the phases of a typical cyberattack and the techniques it might use in each phase. There are many frameworks available within the InfoSec com- munity, including Lockheed Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain® and 12 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Mandiant’s Attacker Lifecycle Model. Our favorite is MITRE’s Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK™) framework. It goes into more depth than most of the others, and its details on post-compromise attacker techniques provide useful guidance on where, what, and how to hunt for evidence of them. ATT&CK isn’t limited to one type of adversary, but instead provides threat-agnostic techniques that are relevant to every threat. Figure 2-1: Attack lifecycle frameworks like MITRE’s ATT&CK™ can help your team think like attackers and focus on likely attack techniques. ON THE WEB You can find information on the web about the MITRE ATT&CK framework, as well as the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain framework and the Mandiant Attack Lifecycle Model. Custom frameworks Although we strongly recommend starting with one of the standard frameworks, you can build on it or combine elements of several frameworks to create a custom framework of your own. No one knows your environment like you do. Chapter 2: Structuring Hunts | 13 For instance, if your organization spans a wide geographic area, you could add time zone-based hunts to your rubric. If certain servers contain key intellectual property, you may want to view their logs to hunt for logins during unusual time periods, or from specific network ranges. By adding awareness of your specific environment into your threat framework, you can enrich other searches and reduce the time necessary to identify malicious activity. It is worth taking time to select or build an attack lifecycle framework to guide your hunt, because it will help your team think like attackers and focus on the attack techniques that are most likely to be used against your organization. TIP Don’t fall into the trap of looking only for threats associated with your industry. While this may feel like a logical way to prioritize, you don’t know what you don’t know. Techniques developed by state-sponsored actors focused on one type of victim can inspire threats that target broad audiences, and vice versa. Frameworks like MITRE’s ATT&CK can help you apply a threat-agnostic approach. Structuring a Hunt Process Every hunt is different, but as we mentioned earlier, structur- ing each one based on the scientific method helps you make the steps repeatable and the results measurable. This section focuses on applying the scientific method to hunt methodol- ogy development. ON THE WEB Robert M. Lee and David Bianco have written a great white paper on hypothesis-driven threat hunting: Generating Hypotheses for Successful Threat Hunting. Step 1: Propose a hypothesis State a reasonable assumption about one or more adversaries and the techniques they might use to enter or persist in your environment. An example might be: “Bad actors will leverage benign and signed Windows binaries to perform malicious activities, which will not be flagged as suspicious by my existing security tools.” 14 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Step 2: Identify evidence to prove the hypothesis Identify the forms of evidence that could prove or disprove the hypothesis and determine how that evidence can be collected. To continue the example started above, you might enable process execution auditing (Windows EID 4688 or Sysmon EID 1) and begin aggregating: ; Process names, paths, hashes, and signing information ; ; Command line arguments Any network destinations captured ; DLLs loaded by the executable Sysmon is capable of returning the same information as detailed process auditing in Windows. It has several advan- tages as well: Sysmon provides more information about par- ent processes, can provide multiple types of file hashes, and describes network connections, among many other valuable capabilities. TIP Don’t stop with one form of evidence; usually two or more are needed to prove a hypothesis with a high degree of confidence. A single source of evidence or visibility can turn out, at the most inconvenient time possible, to be misleading. DON’T FORGET It is important to document the sources of evidence you have chosen, and to ensure that data collected from each source is consistent. Otherwise you may end up with pieces of data that can’t be compared or combined. For example, if you plan to match encoded data against keywords, you should make sure a decoding operation takes place before that data arrives at your console. TECH TALK Chapter 2: Structuring Hunts | 15 Step 3: Develop analytics Describe how the evidence can be reduced, grouped, and ana- lyzed to reach a conclusion. Typically, this involves identifying anomalous activities or sequences of events associated with attacks. Techniques such as prevalence and enrichment (pulling in external metadata to help determine if a given artifact can be characterized as benign or malicious) can dramatically reduce the human effort required for analysis. As you develop analyt- ics, consider the tactical and strategic advantages of these techniques in eliminating false positives and reducing the amount of data you need to analyze. Step 4: Automate Usually you can automate and schedule the process of col- lecting events, performing data reduction, and matching keywords against data. Automation replaces manual processes and frees your hunters to apply their judgement to the results. Ideally, you can allocate tasks that don’t require knowledge or experience to machines, while reserving those that do require judgement to human analysts. ON THE WEB Learn more about automation by reading Endgame’s “Think Offense: Automate the Hunt” white paper. Step 5: Document In the heat of an ongoing hunt it is very tempting to process yet more data and put off documentation until later – or never. However, this is a tactical miscalculation. Usually it is impossible to recall after the fact the details of the hunt: the evidence collected, the types of analysis performed, and the justification for the conclusions. This information will be lost unless it is documented during the course of the hunt, at least at a basic level. TIP When possible, have experienced analysts record their meth- ods for identifying suspicious events. This and other docu- mentation can be extremely valuable to less-experienced members of the hunt team by bringing them up to speed on 16 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting TIP the tactics of attackers and successful hunt techniques. Consider creating a “training dataset” based on some com- monly-performed hunts that you can use to evaluate and train new analysts. While your analysts are documenting the details of the hunt, ask them to highlight opportunities to reduce the volume of data you collect. Typically this involves filtering out known or otherwise trusted events. This practice pays substantial divi- dends, because cutting the amount of data retained ultimately improves your ability to answer questions quickly. Step 6: Communicate and report You should decide at the beginning of a hunt what to com- municate with management and when. This decision includes when to declare that an incident has been detected, and how often to provide updates on the progress of the hunt. At the conclusion of the hunt you should create a record that includes: ; ; ; ; ; ; The metrics of the hunt (discussed below) The root cause of any compromise detected The scope of affected machines, accounts, and applications A description of the techniques detected IOCs to be used for detecting similar attacks Lessons learned and areas for increasing visibility and improving future hunts ; Recommendations for changes to the organization’s security controls TIP As your hunt team matures, track when your recommenda- tions are made and how long before they are implemented. These measurements will give you important clues about the influence of the team. Chapter 2: Structuring Hunts | 17 DON’T FORGET Your organization should have a formal process for sharing the results of hunts with leadership. It is critical to have an executive sponsor with sufficient authority and responsibility to promote the goals of the hunt team. Generally speaking, the greater your executive support, the more influence your team will exercise. Hunt teams should share the results of hunts, improvements to visibility, findings, and resource costs with this sponsor at least quarterly, for wider socialization. Hunt teams that skip this step will have trouble obtaining resources and making improvements. Transitioning to Incident Response Hunt teams do not operate in isolation. At some point they must decide whether to declare an incident and escalate the evidence of malicious behavior to the incident response team for further investigation and remediation. Every organization has its own criteria for making this decision. But if you find yourself in a gray area and need a tie-breaker, step back and consider very basic characteristics of your potential incident: ; ; Is the evidence rare or widespread? Is the evidence recent or has it been present in the environment for a long time? ; Do the activities map to adversary tradecraft? DON’T FORGET Having made your call and declared an incident, spend some time thinking through the incident’s priority. Consider the likelihood that this attack would target your business, indus- try, or region. Estimate the impact it would have on your enterprise if it were successful. You want the incident response team to address the highest risks quickly, but not be overwhelmed by incidents that are unlikely to have much impact. 18 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Measuring Your Hunt Unless you can measure the results of your hunts, you won’t know which ones are successful, if your team is improving over time, or if you are producing important results for your enterprise. Measuring the outcome of each hunt exercise should be discussed during the development phase and refined each time the hunt is performed. Different kinds of metrics can serve different purposes. You can measure how long it took to obtain the necessary data, how many human hours were required to complete the analysis, the average number of findings, and the total time to complete the process. Every hunt gives the team an opportunity to improve on each metric that you have adopted. Was the hypothesis confirmed? For some hunts, the evaluation is binary: our hypothesis is confirmed, or it isn’t. For example, let’s say the hypothesis for a hunt is: “We can identify malicious activity by finding unsigned binaries launched from persistent registry run keys.” The result will be “yes” if you find unsigned executables that were loaded from persistent registry run keys and you associate them with incidents. It will be “no” if you are unable to find any unsigned run keys, or if you find some but deter- mine that they are benign. A hypothesis needs to be sufficiently detailed so that analysts running the hunt can prove or disprove it. Sometimes a hypothesis is too generic to be proven. One common example is: “We can hunt for and find persistent malware.” That is too vague to produce useful results. A more meaningful hypothesis would be something like: “We can find common registry-based malware persistence that leverages Run, RunOnce, ActiveSetup Installed Components, AppInit_DLLs, and Services registry keys.” TIP If you’re just getting started, consider a hunt for each cell in the ATT&CK matrix. You can combine related cells, such as those related to persistent techniques, for group analysis. Chapter 2: Structuring Hunts | 19 How effective was the hunt at finding issues? One measure of the effectiveness of a hunt is the number and severity of incidents and issues it uncovered. You can measure and report the number of: ; Vulnerabilities discovered, and recommendations provided Incidents discovered, grouped by severity ; ; Compromised systems discovered, grouped by sever- ity of the compromise ; Days of dwell time for each incident discovered ; New attacker tactics uncovered TIP Some hunts may not produce findings of any kind–but that does not mean they were failures. Quite the contrary; some- times the only way to detect a technique is by collecting rou- tine data to use as a baseline of normal behavior. When the results of the hunt appear to be negative, it is all the more important to document the process and outcomes. How effective was the team at improving security? You can also try to measure the effectiveness of the team and its impact on the organization, and how those factors change over time. Possible metrics include: ; New sources of evidence integrated into hunt processes ; New methods of data reduction and improvements in searching technology ; Reductions in false positives of incidents ; Hunts escalated to investigations ; Investigations resulting in ongoing attacks being blocked and remediated 20 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting ; Vulnerabilities and bad behaviors corrected as a result of hunt reports Endgame and the MITRE ATT&CK™ Matrix To b e e f fe c t i v e a ga i n s t to d ay ’s soph ist icated attacke rs , secu r i ty p ro g ram s m u s t o p e ra t e w i t h a comprehensive model that covers the full scope of techniques used by adversaries.

Chapter 3 Hunting for Fileless Attacks I n t h i s c h a p t e r Understand the two forms of fileless attacks and how they work Learn how to detect in-memor y attacks Discover techniques for determining if administrative tools are being used by real administrators or by attackers Recently hackers have dramatically increased their use of fileless attacks, also known as non-malware or zero- footprint attacks. Fileless attacks can seem particularly intimi- dating to beginning hunters because there are no recognizable malware files or malicious tools that can be located on a hard drive. There are techniques for detecting them, though. Two Forms of Fileless Attack The term fileless attack is a blanket term to describe two different adversary techniques: using tools and applications already present on a host (“living off the land”), and malware that is memory resident without a filesystem component. Let’s examine the difference and demystify the terms. Living off the land As its name implies, living off the land describes techniques used by attackers to conduct their operations with tools already on a host. Often these are administrative tools or operating system features which, unfortunately, are often more powerful than any custom malware the attackers might build themselves. 22 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting TECH TALK ON THE WEB One very popular example is PowerShell. PowerShell is both a language and an administrative framework built into Windows. It exposes hundreds of commands, called cmdlets, to attackers. Like WMI, it extends all the built-in functions of Windows system programs to allow attackers to enumerate, move later- ally, persist, and execute. These activities and others can be performed via a simple script or using the PowerShell console. Some PowerShell methods allow an adversary to grab the content of a script from an Internet location and execute it in memory – without saving the content of the script to the victim system. In this sense the technique is both living off the land with the native PowerShell framework and executing malware (in the form of a script) in memory. This behavior isn’t that unusual. There are plenty of built-in tools that can interpret a script in this way. For example, the Windows Script Host (WSH) executables wscript.exe and cscript.exe interpret Jscript or VBScript; HTA scripts (JavaScript) can be loaded by the mshta.exe binary. To learn more about how attackers misuse PowerShell, just run a quick Internet search for “PowerShell + hacking.” You will see numerous blogs, videos, presentations, and news headlines. The MITRE page for PowerShell Misuse is: https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1086. PowerShell isn’t the only tool at risk of being exploited by hackers. Any local application or piece of software that allows arbitrary code execution is in danger of being found and leveraged by hackers. Benign tools like Sysinternals BgInfo, which are meant to print system information to the desktop background as wallpaper, can be abused by threat actors to execute malicious VBScript. When hunting these types of tech- niques, remember that the native tools are likely to show up as trusted, so to find evil you need to look at the things they’re interpreting. In-memory malware Another type of fileless attack represents a more literal defini- tion of “fileless”: memory-resident malware. Attackers inject a malicious payload into applications that are already running. Chapter 3: Hunting for Fileless Attacks | 23 This technique can be used to evade controls like some applica- tion whitelisting and antivirus solutions, because the attacker’s code executes in applications that have been approved by the organization. Part of the reason why the use of in-memory attacks is growing so rapidly is that they are no longer the province of sophis- ticated attackers alone. Off-the-shelf offensive frameworks freely available on the Internet enable entire categories of such attacks. These frameworks have dramatically reduced the bar- rier to entry for threat actors of all experience levels. The Detection Arms Race Why do attackers employ fileless techniques? That’s simple: because they evade detection by many existing cybersecurity tools, which attempt to identify attacks by finding malware. Many antimalware products, enterprise and open-source alike, struggle to stay at the forefront of this arms race because adversaries are able to find circuitous ways to evade them. A product that can inspect a downloaded PowerShell script, for example, may not be able to inspect one that is heavily obfuscated, or is stored in a registry key and piped as input to a running process. Fortunately, even fileless attacks create artifacts that provide evidence of techniques used by attackers. Be a Blue Team Champion Does your company have red team- blue team exercises?

Fileless attacks often utilize spear phishing and drive-by down- loads to compromise their victims and gain a foothold on the network. Stagers and cradles and droppers! Oh my! When talking about malware, practitioners often refer to malicious payloads using the terms “stagers,” “cradles,” and “droppers.” While these aren’t interchangeable, we can discuss them generically as a class of malicious files used to introduce additional files or scripts. Some of these can be described as outright malware, where the malicious payload is embedded within another file type, such as a DLL, and extracted on a victim system before being executed. Other droppers might be a script that simply contains a request to download additional malware or scripts. Still others download a stream of shellcode and execute it in memory, either whole or in parts. In-memory execution Ultimately, a malicious payload will be executed. An in- memory attack may take the form of process injection, process hollowing, or side-loading. In the case of process injection, the malware creates or allo- cates some space in process memory, then creates a remote thread to a section of memory within a legitimate process. This process is illustrated in Figure 3-1. Chapter 3: Hunting for Fileless Attacks | 25 Figure 3-1: Fileless attacks often use a dropper to deliver a mali- cious payload that executes in memory. ON THE WEB For an in-depth look at process injection techniques, see the Endgame blog post: Ten Process Injection Techniques: A Technical Survey of Common and Trending Process Injection Techniques. Approaches to Hunting for Fileless Attacks Isolated memory forensics One approach to finding in-memory attacks is to examine a capture of system memory. There are plenty of tools available to assist in the forensic analysis of memory. For example, you can use tools like Volatility, which comes with a suite of built-in plugins, to find injected code residing within legitimate applications. Investigators have successfully used tools like Volatility, mar- garitashotgun, and PowerForensics to acquire process memory and apply analytics at scale. For hunting purposes, you should parse metadata from memory. Usually that only requires col- lecting a few hundred megabytes of metadata per system. Aggressive approaches like collecting full memory captures are impractical when you are working at enterprise scale, because they might require collecting as much as 16GB from each work- station and 128GB from every server. Spam campaign or browsing to a malicious siteDownload the dropperCreates malicious payloadExecutes inmemory 26 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Drowning in noise What about living off the land techniques? You can start by looking for “typical” usage of administrative tools. You will probably generate mountains of data. You will find lots of anomalies to investigate (oh boy!). Then you will spend days discovering all the bizarre and unexpected ways that users and admins operate while doing their legitimate jobs. An anomaly is not automatically suspicious. Some anomalies are just noise. If you find too many false positives, either reclassify what you consider anomalies or find another behavior to monitor. Hunt teams should establish relationships with IT and network operations groups. Working together saves time and helps analysts put anomalies in context. DON’T FORGET Technique-based Detection TECH TALK Threat hunting in memory There are some open sources tools to help you examine memory to find evidence of malicious behavior. One is the PowerShell library Get-InjectedThreads, developed by Joe Desimone of Endgame and Jared Atkinson of SpecterOps. In a relatively low-noise approach, this tool scans active threads on the system for suspicious start addresses that may indicate process injection has occurred. For example, an attacker might call VirtualAllocEx to allocate space for malicious code to execute, and then utilize CreateRemoteThread or another API call to execute the malicious code within another application. Get- InjectedThreads will retrieve the start address of each active thread, then determine the associated section properties. If there is an observed executable running within this section, it is deemed to be injected. But keep in mind that some legitimate applications perform process injection (and you might also run across an injected thread and alert). Chapter 3: Hunting for Fileless Attacks | 27 ON THE WEB For a presentation describing threat hunting in memory in detail and explaining how to use Get-InjectedThreads, watch this video from the SANS Threat Hunting Summit 2017 conference: Taking Hunting to the Next Level. Timing is everything A theme throughout this guide is how you can use time to assist you in your hunt, or more precisely, how determining a sequence of events can point to malicious activities. In a living off the land scenario, the attacker wants to launch a native admin tool to execute malicious commands. But while the tool may be nothing out of the ordinary, like PowerShell, the way it is launched may indicate malicious intent. If you examine the parent process lineage of PowerShell or other admin tools, you might find some interesting artifacts. For example, you might observe a local admin tool being executed as child of your email application a few minutes after an email is received. This is a good indicator of something suspicious, perhaps part of a spear phishing attack. Another example would be seeing many enumeration com- mands (such as ipconfig, net *, whoami, systeminfo, or netstat) being run in a very short time. This behavior would be consistent with an attacker’s attempt to discover more about a network quickly by running these commands manually or from a script. System administrators use the same commands, but not all of them, and not within a few seconds. Searching for intent As we noted earlier, attackers may try to look like administra- tors in your network, but they do different things. You can look for running admin applications that are exhibiting non-admin behaviors. See if you can find unusual command line parameters. For example, you might turn up PowerShell being executed with encoded parameters, hidden windows, or other unusual execu- tion parameters such as “-e *,” “-en *,” and “-ep *.” You can also search for native Windows applications that allow code execution, for instance installUtil.exe, regsvr32, regasm. 28 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting exe, or even rundll32.exe. Look for these signed and trusted applications being executed, and closely examine the command line parameters and contents of memory sections allocated. Finally, you can hunt for suspicious network activity associated with local tools. If you see a lot of outbound connections from tools designed for internal system maintenance, it is probably not the work of legitimate systems administrators.

Chapter 4 Hunting for Persistence – Basics I n t h i s c h a p t e r Learn why attackers need persistence, and why it can be their Achilles’ heel. Review basic techniques for hunting for evidence of persistence. Why Adversaries Need Persistence Some intruders can reach their targets during the first rush of their attack. They gain temporary access, just enough to complete their mission, and then withdraw, cleaning up as they go. Much more often, however, adversaries have to play a long game: establishing a beachhead on one host, maintaining contact with an external server they control, obtaining new credentials, moving laterally to other systems, locating targets, obtaining data, and then exfiltrating the data. To do this, they must be able to maintain a presence in the victim environment that survives reboots and access interruptions. For this reason, persistence is usually one of an attacker’s first objectives. After all that work to access the victim’s system, why risk losing control because of a power outage or a software update that forces a restart? In some complex intrusions, establishing persistence is a cyclic process that ebbs and flows based on factors like shifting adversary goals, changes to the environment, and interaction with the security team. As attackers compromise additional 30 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting TIP ON THE WEB ON THE WEB systems, they may install more tools and malware to afford themselves more persistent footholds. Some organized threat actors even install multiple types of malware, with different forms of persistence and capabilities, so that even if one or two are discovered they retain a presence on other hosts. It can be perilous to try to clean up infected systems. If a threat group has deployed multiple forms of malware with different persistence mechanisms, you may miss some. It is safer to rebuild infected systems from a trusted image. If you do decide to clean up, make certain the affected hosts are restricted to minimal access from the local network and can communicate only with trusted destinations. Their need is your opportunity But persistence is the Achilles’ heel of many attackers. You can find persistence mechanisms and use them to begin unravelling the chain of techniques used in the attack. While a multitude of persistence techniques exist, the majority of threats leverage just a handful, so in your hunts you can start out by prioritizing the most common ones. If you want to understand the tremendous number of persis- tence options, look no further than the Beyond good ol’ Run key series on the Hexacorn.com blog. Started in 2012, it covers dozens of the most common, uncommon, and rare methods of achieving persistence. You should take the time to understand how each persistence method functions and how it can be detected. Another technical blog with good material on persis- tence is enigma0x3. You should also review the MITRE ATT&CK™ matrix section on persistence at: https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Persistence. Studying the tactics outlined there regularly will improve your ability to identify and analyze persistence techniques at scale. Even fileless attacks use persistence Some security professionals are intimidated by fileless attacks. But as we discussed in Chapter 3, you shouldn’t be. They are simply a class of techniques that don’t depend on malware or any other type of file stored on the host’s file system. Techniques for fileless attacks include: Chapter 4: Hunting forPersistence – Basics | 31 ; Storing shellcode within a registry key value, executed by a generally benign Windows application ; Storing a script within a data structure like the WMI CIM or another database, executed by a script pro- cessor such as the Windows Script Host (WSH) ; Using a PowerShell cmdlet to download malicious scripts from an Internet location and passing them to one of several utilities ; Using stored procedures to perform inline compila- tion of C# or other code But don’t confuse “fileless” with “undetectable.” Although there are no tell-tale files pointing to an attack, there are many types of evidence you can use to hunt for malicious execu- tion. Many of the best involve finding evidence of persistence mechanisms. You can examine the registry, audit running processes, and audit process lineages of ancestors and their descendants. For example, if you decide to hunt for shellcode stored in a registry key, it is a fairly trivial task to search all registry keys for the shellcode representing a compiled binary. By perform- ing a content search of registry keys for the executable file header, you can identify suspicious keys in short order. TECH TALK A compiled binary with an intact PE header will begin with the hexadecimal string “0x5a4d” (for “MZ” – the initials of Mark Zbikowski, one of the developers of the MS-DOS operating system). The Windows Registry Most organizations begin hunting for persistence in the Windows registry. For those who haven’t been exposed to it much, the registry is an improvement on host and application configuration man- agement. Before the introduction of the registry to maintain centralized configurations on a per-host basis, these settings used to be stored in configuration files! The popularity of the registry in threat hunting is due in part to the array of free and low-cost methods for querying it. 32 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Those include PowerForensics and Sysinternals Autoruns, powerful free tools that increase your visibility into a multitude of persistence techniques. You can start your search by investigating registry locations that commonly contain evidence of persistence, such as Run and RunOnce keys, and Windows Services keys. Although these are only a handful of the keys in the registry, they are used by a substantial percentage of malicious malware families and samples. If you subscribe to a threat feed that includes IOCs, you can search for the registry keys mentioned in that feed. Set up an automated process to collect the data, match it against IOCs, and present the results to analysts as alerts. Manual IOC matching is inefficient and unnecessary; those hours are better spent advancing coverage of ATT&CK, implementing controls, and performing meaningful analyses. DON’T FORGET Technique-based Detection TIP While it may be tempting to just match IOCs against your available evidence and call it a success, that’s not really threat hunting. This section focuses on techniques hunters can begin with to detect persistence techniques. For most organizations, this process begins by prioritizing sources of evidence, con- ducting analyses, and using environmental awareness to help reduce the volume of data. You can greatly reduce the volume of data you collect and retain by profiling the base image of each system type in your organization for default persistence locations. Knowing the profile of workstations and servers when they are deployed for the first time (including the known good metadata of executa- bles, scripts, and other files) makes changes from the baseline more obvious to analysts. Data collection Before you start collecting event data that can be used to detect persistence techniques, it can be helpful to assess which sources of evidence capture the metadata most comprehensively. Chapter 4: Hunting forPersistence – Basics | 33 Consider, for example, the challenges of monitoring changes to the registry using Windows event logs. Many applications use a registry key of some kind for persistence and overwrite it every time the application starts and stops. Imagine this occurring across a universe of 10,000 systems, around the clock, for several years. The important changes can be cap- tured with tools like Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and Sysmon. TECH TALK When you consider the costs of using Windows and Sysmon events for persistence hunting, be aware of the following EIDs and events: --Sysmon ID-- 12 RegistryEvent 13 RegistryEvent 14 RegistryEvent --Windows events-- 4663(S): 4656(S, F): 4658(S): 4660(S) 4657(S): 5039(-): 4670(S): --Tag-- Registry object added or deleted Registry value set Registry object renamed An attempt was made to access an object. A handle to an object was requested. The handle to an object was closed. An object was deleted. A registry value was modified. A registry key was vir tualized. Permissions on an object were changed. TIP Unfortunately, relying solely on these events for hunting per- sistence presents considerable challenges. If you don’t have Sysmon or an easy way to parse Windows events, then Sysinternals Autoruns is a great place to start. This is a free tool (with command line!) to pull artifacts from your environ- ment. The tool is configured to run automatically. You can task it to run on your endpoints and retrieve persistent arti- facts. We recommend storing the results in Elastic Stack or another database system because it will make your hunting and querying much more efficient. 34 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting TIP Windows isn’t the only operating system with a notion of per- sistence. In fact, every operating system has various forms of persistence. However, gaining visibility into persistence mech- anisms at enterprise scale outside of the Windows world can be challenging. One useful tool is OSQuery. Discussed in Appendix A, OSQuery was developed by Facebook and released to the public for use inspecting Windows, Linux, and MacOS systems. OSQuery supports the ability to query a variety of persistence mechanisms. Simple hunts for persistence Once you have some events and artifacts, you can begin con- ducting hunts based on simple questions. Ideally, each question should be focused on a single form of persistence, for example: ; Across the enterprise, which persistent objects (exe- cutables, scripts, etc.) are using Run or RunOnce keys? ; Which daemons are running on Linux web serv- ers? Are the hashes custom or part of the National Software Reference Library (NSRL)? ; Which accounts are modifying persistence mecha- nisms on MacOS systems? ; Which persistent objects are signed versus unsigned? ; Do any persistent objects have a history of initiating network connections (or even the ability to do so)? Where to? ; Across the enterprise, which logon scripts are being used when authentication succeeds? ; Which device drivers are persistent? When you’re establishing your first hunts for persistence mech- anisms, tackle one cell of the Enterprise ATT&CK matrix at a time. That enables you to measure discrete techniques. After a while you will be able to move beyond these simple questions and use more sophisticated techniques to search and analyze the data, refine your processes, and make them more efficient. Chapter 5 Hunting for Persistence at Scale I n t h i s c h a p t e r Review techniques for collecting and analyzing data across the enterprise to find evidence of persistence Understand how visualization can reveal key information quickly and at scale Taking It to the Enterprise Many organizations begin with simple queries or play- books, then progress to more complex workflows. In this section, we’ll look at a few types of analyses that can be applied at enterprise scale. These include statistical approaches like least-frequency analysis, and differential analyses like baseline comparisons. Questions to ask at scale When you take an enterprise-wide perspective, you can start asking questions like these: ; Of all scheduled tasks, named and unnamed, what are the hashes of the JOB files themselves, and what payloads have they kicked? Sort the results in descending order by frequency. ; Which persistent binaries make network connec- tions outside the environment, and are there any seemingly unrelated persistent objects communicat- ing with the same destinations? 36 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting ; What is the distribution of certificate authorities (CAs) associated with persistent objects across the enterprise? Do any of those CAs have a weak or poor reputation based on open source research? ; Which Windows persistence objects may be vulner- able to search-order hijacking techniques? (Quick hint: DLLs listed in the Known_DLLs key can be eliminated first!) ON THE WEB The Endgame blog is a good source of information on advanced techniques for persistence and how to find them. See, for example: How To Hunt: Detecting Persistence & Evasion With The COM. Frequency and outlier analysis Frequency-of-occurrence and outlier analyses are two common statistical approaches to finding evil, and they are good ways to begin assessing your environment at enterprise scale. It is a general principle that if the same persistent object is on every system it is too common to be malicious. Note that this principle is a guideline, not a rule. Self- propagating malware like crypto-miner malware can spread across an unguarded enterprise very quickly, creating persis- tence mechanisms as it expands its foothold. In addition to the statistically-based analyses mentioned ear- lier, you can consider answering questions like these: ; What payloads associated with any Windows-based persistence mechanism occur least frequently? Most frequently? ; What is the distribution of network connections associated with previously unknown scripts and executables on Linux systems? ; What rare and unique (based on hashes) volume boot records (VBRs) exist across all endpoints? What network locations and running processes are unique to those endpoints? Chapter 5: Hunting for Persistence at Scale | 37 TIP Don’t be discouraged if frequency and outlier analysis some- times produces inconclusive results. Environments are hetero- geneous, and you are probably dealing with (relatively) small data sets. But don’t give up – sometimes these techniques have a big payoff! Comparative analysis What better way to find suspicious persistence items than comparing registry items to a baseline image? (Assuming you have one!) Persistence is one area (among many) where comparisons with baselines can be a very effective method for data reduction. If you compare persistence artifacts from your baseline (e.g., autoruns) against production systems, you can identify differ- ences between those datasets. This isn’t a foolproof hunt, and you may want to dig a little deeper before sounding the alarm, but it narrows data for further inspection. Some second-order analyses you can perform include examin- ing signing certificates and SSL certificates used in network communication, stacking DNS queries by time-t0-live (a shorter TTL value means the DNS record is configured to change IPs quickly), and looking at when associated fully- qualified domain names (FQDNs) were registered. More suggestions for comparative analysis are available in this Endgame blog post: How To Hunt: Finding The Delta. For a detailed discussion on how to create a Windows baseline and use it for comparative analysis, see the SANS Institute white paper: Quick and Effective Windows System Baselining and Comparative Analysis for Troubleshooting and Incident Response. Temporal proximity You can tell a tremendous amount from looking at the sequence and timing of events: what we might call “temporal proximity” or “contemporariness.” It is helpful to know whether other interesting events occurred when persistence mechanisms were created or changed. For example, if a key was created or modified, what was the order of the operations? Were there corresponding process ON THE WEB 38 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting events preceding the creation or modification of the key in the registry? If so, the process event is suspicious, and you should investigate that key. You might want to ask: ; Was a file created and then executed before the key change? ; Did the executable change the DNS servers config- ured on the endpoint before resolving an FQDN to an IP address? ; Did the executable immediately download and execute scripts that communicated directly with IP addresses we’ve never seen? If these events aren’t consistent with patterns you recognize, you should treat the process event as suspicious, and you should investigate that system. Data enrichment It can be incredibly difficult to deal with the staggering volumes of data found in modern enterprises. One way to gain a little control is to improve your data quality through enrichment. You can use popular methods such as: ; ; Setting up automatic searches of MD5 hashes in VirusTotal Checking signer information (untrusted files in the registry could be malware) ; If you have a strict software install process, looking for installed applications in the registry that don’t appear on the approved list. (The list should be small if you examine a specific category such as run keys.) ; Using a sandbox to determine the behaviors of executables based on function imports and dynamic execution ; Ingesting DNS history and searching for persistence mechanisms that perform DNS lookups Chapter 5: Hunting for Persistence at Scale | 39 During enrichment, try to capture and compare both local and enterprise conditions. For example, if you observed that HOSTA performed a DNS query for www.my-evil-domain. org, make sure you capture what that FQDN resolved to at the endpoint, and at a central location in your enterprise. Except in a few exceptional situations, these should use the same authoritative name server and resolve to the same address. You are likely to find that applications using distributed DNS will pop up here and there, but as you identify those excep- tions, simply document them. Visualization Visualization tools can greatly strengthen your ability to under- stand and interpret hunt data. They are especially important when dealing with large datasets (and autorun data sets quickly become very large). There are many free tools for visualizing data. Here we discuss some approaches to visualization using D3.js, a JavaScript library that can be used to visualize data. Here are examples of how you can use visualization to support outlier analysis and category chaining to parse large amounts of autorun data. Visualization to find outliers Figure 5-1 is a D3.js radial plot of a type that we jokingly call “the Persistence Flower.” The image in this guide is small, but a larger version makes it easy to see which data points appear as outliers. Figure 5-1: A radial plot makes it easy to see which data points appear to be outliers. 40 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting You can also use bar graphs and histograms to show data; choose the visualization that makes it easiest for you to identify anomalies. Category chaining You can also present data in a hierarchical view. Sysinternals autoruns provide a lot of useful artifacts, and with a visualiza- tion tool we can assign levels to all data objects. In Figure 5-2, D3.js creates a collapsible tree based on a hier- archy we defined as having three levels: category, value, and arguments. This visualization highlights a rogue PowerShell script, and provides insight into scheduled tasks. Figure 5-2: A collapsible tree provides a hierarchical view of data. ON THE WEB Information about D3.js is available on the Data Driven Documents website. Example: WMI Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is Microsoft’s implementation of web-based enterprise management (WBEM). WBEM can be described as a way to manage your enterprise using common interfaces. For practitioners who have used WMI, this framework exposes a SQL-like command line utility that is incredibly powerful for both administrators and adversaries. Chapter 5: Hunting for Persistence at Scale | 41 ON THE WEB You can find more information about WMI and how it can be maliciously used in two whitepapers: Abusing WMI to Build a Persistent, Asynchronous, and Fileless Backdoor and WMI for Detection and Response. You can also see one of the authors of this guide giving a presentation: There’s Something About WMI. Without leaving the WMI console, a person can query just about any aspect of a Windows environment. You can use it to gather data for hunting, and attackers can use it just as easily to perform enterprise reconnaissance. WMI can also be used to give malware persistence. There are a few ways to accomplish this, the most popular being the use of _EventConsumers and _EventFilters. There’s an easy way to differentiate between them: ; ; An _EventFilter is a condition you test for, or a trigger An _EventConsumer is the result of meeting that condition If you used an _EventFilter that tested for a specific user to login, you could then configure an action like executing an application. This may sound obscure, but it’s really not that daunting. There are many ways to query changes to WMI, such as WMI itself, Sysinternals Autoruns, PowerShell cmdlets, and several open source tools. If you want to query your environment for _EventFilters and _EventConsumers, you could use the follow- ing commands on each system: Get-wmiobject -namespace root\\subscription -query “select * from _EventFilter” Get-wmiobject -namespace root\\subscription -query “select * from _EventConsumer” TECH TALK If this is your first time looking at common WMI persistence mechanisms, you may need to put in a little work understand- ing exactly what should be present. Most important, every Windows system should have at least the BVTFilter or the BVTConsumer, which are designed for use with Windows serv- ers. At least one of these should be present on systems with 42 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Windows 7 and above, and they should launch a VBScript called “kern- cap.vbs.” You should always confirm the presence of this VBScript and verify that it has not been modified from a known trusted hash. Here’s why: threat actors have learned that you can overwrite this VBScript with malicious code on workstations very easily, and with no consequences.

Chapter 6 Hunting for Lateral Movement I n t h i s c h a p t e r Understand why attackers need mobility Review some of the ways attackers move laterally Learn how to determine when PsExec, a tool used by system administrators, is being employed by an attacker for lateral movement and remote execution Detecting lateral movement is a great way to find evidence of threats. You have to be careful, however, because the same tools and protocols leveraged by threat actors during an intrusion are sometimes used by system administrators for benign purposes. There are a few ways to classify lateral movement techniques. Here we’ll refer to: ; ; ; Protocols that enable remote authentication, such as SSH, SMB, and RDP Frameworks designed for remote execution, such as WinRM, WMI, and RPC Techniques that don’t rely on a protocol or frame- work to support remote access or execution, such as the “Sticky Keys” feature abuse 44 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Why Adversaries Need Mobility Sometimes threat actors know in advance what users or systems to target to complete their mission. Far more often, though, an attacker who gains a foothold in your enterprise has to undertake a discovery process to gain information about hosts, users, and data of interest. Once a target is identified, the attacker must move across the network to obtain what they need before the environment becomes hostile. To move laterally, threat actors often employ tools built into operating systems, such as SSH, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and Windows Remote Management (WinRM). Other times the attacker introduces a tool like Windows Sysinternals PsExec. Several of these tools have the option of specifying a target username and password, while others are capable of using the current user context and trans- parently authenticating to a remote system. Attackers can even use multi-purpose features of operating systems. An example is the notorious Sticky Keys Attack. This attack has been employed to escalate privileges, enable lateral movement, and provide a poor man’s backdoor to hosts. It works because a hidden but well-known accessibility feature allows a user to press the SHIFT key several times to trigger access to an on-screen keyboard. A very minor change to either the registry or filesystem is all it takes to trigger access to the Windows console “cmd.exe.” This attack is classified as tech- nique T1015 by MITRE in ATT&CK™ and applies to several other applications. Some adversaries are capable of exceptionally accurate target- ing, precluding the need for lateral movement. This reinforces how important it is for organizations to pursue maximum cov- erage of their chosen attack framework – such as the MITRE ATT&CK matrix – and the benefits of implementing security controls that inhibit features your organization doesn’t use for day-to-day operations. TECH TALK DON’T FORGET Chapter 6: Hunting for Lateral Movement | 45 An Example: Hunting for Suspicious Use of PsExec At first, hunting for lateral movement can seem like an uphill battle. That’s because attackers and system administrators often use the same tools and techniques to move laterally. But the process need not be terribly daunting if you “eat the whale one bite at a time.” In this section we discuss how to detect evidence that someone is using the Sysinternals PsExec tool to interact with a remote system in an unauthorized manner. About PsExec PsExec, a utility included in the Sysinternals PsTools suite of software, is one of the more common lateral movement tools associated with remote execution. It is described in product literature as a “telnet replacement” that can be executed using the Windows console or via third-party software. PsExec has been widely adopted by administrators at organiza- tions of all kinds and is regularly encountered on Windows systems. However, attackers were quick to adopt it for the very same reasons as administrators. In an environment where both admins and adversaries have the same tools, discovering mali- cious actions can be extremely challenging. DON’T FORGET If your organization doesn’t employ PsExec, you should imple- ment controls that prevent it from being used, and treat any detected use of PsExec as a security incident. Technique-based detection PsExec is a unique tool for lateral movement and remote execution (a) because it isn’t native to the operating system, and (b) because of the way it works. PsExec starts the remote logon process using supplied cre- dentials and performs a quick check to see if it can copy a file and execute it using the hidden $ADMIN share on the target system. If no errors are received, it unpacks a binary from within itself, “PSEXESVC.EXE,” which is executed on the remote host as a 46 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting TIP temporary service (PSEXESVC) and then deleted. If $ADMIN isn’t available, PsExec will try using another hidden share, $IPC. There are several hidden shares exposed on every Windows endpoint by default, but they are relatively easy to disable through an update to Group Policy (GPO). If you don’t require these hidden shares for a legitimate business purpose, you should disable them so they can’t be used by adversaries dur- ing the reconnaissance and lateral movement phases of an attack. Examine Event Logs You can capture evidence of the use of PsExec on target sys- tems by examining several sources of forensic data, which vary according to the target operating system. Sources of evidence found in Windows events logs include: ; ; EID 5145, which contains metadata about requests for access to the hidden $ADMIN and $IPC shares; these logs indicate the responsible process (look for PsExec). EID 5140, which indicates a share was successfully accessed, may confirm that an attempt succeeded, as well as the account used and other supporting evidence. ; EIDs 4697 and 7045, which record service creation, may capture the installation of the temporary PSEXESVC service. ; Detailed process execution, captured in EID 4688 events, can identify the use of PsExec on both source and target systems, including full command line arguments. ; Sysmon, a free logging utility, captures detailed pro- cess execution in EID 1 and includes parent process, network, and user metadata. Chapter 6: Hunting for Lateral Movement | 47 TIP Teams with access to these sources of evidence should begin by assessing how commonly PsExec appears in the environment, and whether it is known to be used legitimately. From there, they can identify which systems are common sources of PsExec for remote execution, and which accounts are most commonly used for authentication. Coordinate with IT and network operations to better determine if common tools, accounts, and systems are legitimate. Most security teams don’t have the environmental awareness neces- sary to understand how these resources are used. Relationships with operations groups can also be leveraged during an inci- dent to mobilize a response, support data collection, and implement preventative controls and enhanced logging. ON THE WEB For a primer on investigating the use of PsExec, watch the video of this presentation by Matt Bromiley and Brian Marks: Skynet Will Use PsExec When SysInternals Go Bad. How much data do you need? Organizations building out a hunt capability may feel com- pelled to enable excessive logging to cover techniques like lateral movement with PsExec. Retaining the events associated with NTLM and KERBEROS authentication is an excellent decision, but for every minute of system activity many dozens of individual records may be created. In contrast, the logs associated with share access change much less frequently, so you don’t have to search through so much data. For that reason, you can get started by focusing on EID 5145 events and hold off for a while on other sources of evidence. In the next section we’ll discuss analysis options for this event type. Analyze Metadata We know, based on our understanding of PsExec internals, that it will check the attributes of shares on the target system. We also know, based on our understanding of the Windows operating system, that checking those attributes is something that generates an EID 5145 event. 48 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Begin by analyzing EID 5145 events. These include the follow- ing types of metadata: ; ; ; ; The time the event was recorded (will vary) The source of the request (Service Control Manager) The name of the service (PSEXECSVC, but note that this is configurable) The service executable (%systemroot%\\psexecsvc. exe, also configurable) The service name and executable created on the target are configurable by an adversary. That shouldn’t be a major stum- bling block when it comes to accessing hidden shares, though. Analysts need to understand all the valid services that query share attributes and lead to the generation of these events. In your environment, you should be documenting these valid ser- vices. That way, when you see a service with an odd name like “WjjNnsdsd12sdkj” trying to access the $IPC share, you can be certain something is fishy. Analyze Process Events In addition to logs of share access and service creation events, evidence of process execution (either native or via Sysmon) can help to reveal the questionable use of PsExec and other mali- cious executables. For analysis of running processes, a generic approach can be helpful for getting started. This might consist of asking a few important questions about each process you observe, for example: ; What was the application and the application meta- data (filename, path, hash, size, PE version informa- tion, command line arguments, etc.)? ; Was it recorded during a known operational window? ; Was a valid account associated with the execution, and was this account used during it’s normal opera- tional window? ; Was the process associated with network activity? Chapter 6: Hunting for Lateral Movement | 49 TIP It is a good practice to capture detailed process execution data for all systems. However, some enterprises may find capturing share access events is sufficient for hunting. By forwarding only specific events from endpoints to a central location, you might be able to have your cake and eat it too. Retain the most impor- tant events in a central location for hunting, while keeping several days’ worth on endpoints for investigative purposes. New process creation auditing can be enabled on Windows, which causes 4688 events to be recorded. These logs contain a wealth of valuable information about processes but can gener- ate a substantial amount of data. A 4688 event, generated on the source and target, contains: ; ; ; The time the event was recorded The user context (account ID, name, domain, ses- sion ID) Process metadata (ID, full path to executable, privi- lege token, parent process ID, parent process full path, full command line) DON’T FORGET Think how much faster you could assess whether PsExec is being used for legitimate purposes if you could see exactly how it is used (a thought that applies to any process, not just PsExec!). Find out how your system administrators and other authorized personnel use tools like PsExec. Taking this information into account will dramatically reduce the number of false positives you need to sort through. If you’re using a specific version, with a specific hash and other metadata you’ve documented, it is even easier to detect legitimate use of these tools. Analyze Command Line Arguments For analysis, helpful metadata includes details associated with the process itself. Of these, command line arguments are the most useful. Adversaries can change some of the attributes of PsExec to hide their tracks, but they can’t alter the command line arguments it accepts. 50 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Let’s look at a quick example where the PsExec utility on the source has been renamed “termsvr.exe”: termsevr.exe \\\\HOSTA -u HOSTA\\administrator -p probably.shared.admin.pw –accepteula -s -r TerminalServiceManager This command executes PsExec (termsevr.exe) to run on a remote system (HOSTA) using the local administrator cre- dentials (local administrator) and the password (“probably. shared.admin.pw”). The “—accepteula” flag automatically accepts the EULA to prevent interrupted execution, while modifying the registry on the target. The “-s” flag escalates privileges to SYSTEM when possible. Finally, the “-r” flag instructs PsExec to run as a different service on the target (TerminalServiceManager). If you were looking for the “PSEXESVC” service or the “PSEXESVC.exe” service executable, you’d be sorely disap- pointed. However, you could look for any executable that uses the “—accepteula” flag and the “\\\\” network resource prefix. You can combine this information with the event log metadata we’ve already discussed to develop an understanding of both normal and abnormal use of PsExec for lateral movement and remote command execution. Endgame Point of View Endgame is focused on prov id ing co ve ra ge a c ro s s th e te ch n i q u e s o f t h e M I T R E AT T& C K™ m a t r i x .

Chapter 7 Credential Theft I n t h i s c h a p t e r Understand why attackers need to capture and exploit user credentials Explore an example of a credential thef t technique – KERBEROASTING – and how it can be detected Credentials are to attackers what bearer bonds are to bank robbers: whoever holds them, owns them. The threat actor who captures the right credentials can access systems, data, networks, and applications almost at will. In this chapter we discuss why capturing credentials is so important for threat actors, the most common methods they use, and typical targets. We also look at a common KERBEROS-based attack as an example, and at techniques you can use to detect credential theft. Survival by Any Means Necessary As reluctant as security professionals are to admit the fact, attackers rarely face much of a challenge gaining a foothold in victim environments. Once inside, however, the threat actor faces a series of hurdles. The first of these is understanding the configuration of the environment. Like a burglar in a dark house at night, the attacker needs to quickly discover the layout, including the people and the targets (in this case the users, data, and systems of interest). 52 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Even with the discovery process complete, however, the job is far from over. The attacker must find ways to escalate privi- leges, acquire the ability to move around freely, and map the interesting places. You should not be surprised to find that there are many ways to capture valid credentials. Among the multitude of options are: ; Cracking NTLM hashes (which still works in many environments) ; Dumping clear-text credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service, LSASS ; Using Silver and Golden Ticket attacks (both very popular) ; Cracking KERBEROS service tickets (KERBEROASTING) with weak passwords To illustrate how attackers work, we examine KERBEROASTING, a common way to obtain credentials. Example: KERBEROASTING The basics of KERBEROS KERBEROS is used in Active Directory environments to authenticate users. It is one of the most popular security support providers (SSPs), otherwise known as authentication protocols, available for Windows. When users on HOSTA want to log onto HOSTB, they type in a domain username and password, and immediately find out if the authentication is successful. Behind the scenes, though, Windows takes a number of steps (illustrated in Figure 7-1): 1. The password is hashed, and an authentication request is sent to the domain controller, which validates the user and hash material. 2. The domain controller sends back a ticket-granting ticket, or TGT. Chapter 7: Credential Thef t | 53 3. With the TGT, a request is sent to the domain controller on behalf of the user for a ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket. 4. The domain controller validates the TGS request and sends back a reply with the TGS ticket. 5. The TGS ticket is handed off to HOSTB from HOSTA. 6. The user is able to access HOSTB from HOSTA. Figure 7-1: The KERBEROS authentication process (diagram courtesy of Sean Metcalf and adsecurity.org) How attackers KERBEROAST What is the problem? It concerns service principal names (SPNs). Some SPNs are assigned to privileged groups such as domain administrators. But domain controllers don’t care if you query some or all SPNs without actually requesting access to a remote system. As a result, an attacker can look up SPNs with any valid account and use that information for targeting. Here is how KERBEROASTING works. The attacker: 1. Phishes into the environment and gains a foothold on the workstation of a domain user who is also in the local admins group. 2. Locally escalates privileges using the domain account, and uses a tool to obtain credentials (Benjamin Delpy’s Mimikatz does this very well). 54 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting 3. Uses a native Windows tool that doesn’t trigger alerts to query the domain password policy and to query the SPNs of all service accounts (because in the victim environment those don’t ever expire, and they have the same rights as a domain administrator). 4. Requests a TGS for one of the SPNs – and the domain controller responds with an encrypted TGS ticket. 5. Uses the Mimikatz output obtained earlier or a diction- ary wordlist, and a tool like Hashcat, to begin cracking and obtaining the plaintext password of the target SPN. Two Techniques for Hunting Credential Theft Technique-based detection So, how can we uncover credential theft? The first approach is our old friend, technique-based detection. In the case of KERBEROASTING, you can enable auditing of KERBEROS service ticket operations. This will record an event (EID 4769) for each TGS request. You can then monitor these events and look for patterns that don’t make sense for legitimate users. For example, it is highly unusual for a single account to submit multiple requests in a short timeframe. Yet you might observe an event as noisy as a dozen or more records per day for one user. Bingo! For each TGS request, the record will also list the account, the domain, the hostname from which the request was made, and the encryption metadata. That information allows you to fol- low up, confirm that credential theft has taken place, and take appropriate actions to disable captured credentials. Detecting host:user anomalies Another method of detecting KERBEROASTING involves looking for encryption flags that didn’t match the domain default. This technique is not always reliable against sophis- ticated attackers who have more powerful tools to support KERBEROASTING, but it can still be effective in older and smaller-scale environments.

Appendix A Getting Started For organizations building their hunt capability from the ground up, it can be challenging to get started. Endgame has collected the following free and open source resources into this appendix to help lower the barriers to entry. Readers should be aware that commercial solutions may provide addi- tional features and capabilities. This section has been broken into two parts. The first describes resources applied to endpoints, and the second discusses solutions for event aggregation. Endpoint assets The definition of endpoint assets has expanded recently to include mobile and embedded devices in addition to Windows, Linux, and MacOS systems. Here we focus on traditional operating systems, which represent the biggest challenge for organizations just starting out. For each type of endpoint, we look at native logging applications and share log configuration resources. This information will help you streamline your data collection process and begin hunting faster. Generally speaking, the default logging facility and settings of an operating system will need changes to become effective. Windows Microsoft Windows includes some of the most popular client and server software in production today. At the time of this writing, Windows versions 7 and 8 are slowly losing ground on desktops to Windows 10 – which includes a number of unique security features and enhancements such as Device and Credential Guard. Windows Server 2016 is considered popular, though 2008 and 2012 Windows Server versions are still around. Appendix A: Getting Star ted | 57 The default audit policy for Windows is not sufficient for orga- nizations that need to proactively identify threats. Fortunately, for those who don’t have the means to deploy other logging tools, this policy can be easily and quickly updated. The following resources should help you quickly deploy a pow- erful advanced auditing policy on Windows: ; ; ; Jessica Payne’s blog post on Windows Event Forwarding Additional WEF resources Sean Metcalf’s article on Securing Active Directory A well-known alternative to the default logging capability is Sysinternals’ Sysmon utility. Sysmon provides visibility into DLL loads, detailed command line arguments, parent process metadata, network connections, changes to the registry, and WMI interaction. The “sysmon-dfir” github repository contains some of the most comprehensive information about deploying Sysmon for hunting. Linux The Linux operating system achieved a large and very stable base of support many years ago, and represents one of the largest classes of endpoint software for desktops, directory ser- vices, web servers, proxies, and numerous other applications. However, few resources exist for gaining visibility into Linux systems. By default, Linux logging includes authentication data and cron events, but doesn’t provide much other visibility into historical process or network events. Modern Linux systems may have one or more of the following installed: ; Syslog, an older and established logging service ; Rsyslog, which includes some improvements on Syslog ; Systemd and journald, the logging facilities installed on systems implementing Systemd for system management 58 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting To achieve some of the same results that Sysmon delivers for Windows, Linux systems can benefit from the Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) system. IMA works with other Linux auditing services to capture and provide process execution metadata based on its configuration. MacOS While older version of the MacOS operating system included large collections of logs in different formats, Sierra (as well as the iOS10, WatchOS and tvOS versions) introduced unified logging to replace syslog. The default logging, however, is more useful for developers than for threat hunters and analysts. Mobile Organizations are slowly realizing that mobile devices are essential to their success, and are permitting employees to supply their own. These dual-purpose devices are rarely man- aged at the enterprise level, even though they freely migrate between corporate and non-corporate networks. This means an adversary has a much easier time gaining a foothold through a mobile device than through dealing with your layered corpo- rate security stack, at least in environments where bring your own device (BYOD) is allowed. At the time of this writing, we have not found a default mechanism for auditing authentication, process, or network events on mobile devices. Further, we know of few open source enterprise solutions – OSQuery does not provide support for Android or iOS devices. OSQuery and multiple operating systems Yet another option, which supports several operating systems, is Facebook’s OSQuery. This agent-based application logs almost 200 different types of events across Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and MacOS. The schema and query language uses a familiar, SQL-like format. OSQuery even offers options for searching containers, file events, DNS requests, Amazon EC2 instances, hardware-based events, browser extensions, software installs, and installed patches. Appendix A: Getting Star ted | 59 Aggregation and Storage Generating the right events to the right level of detail is just one part of an effective hunting capability. It is also essential to have powerful, scalable capabilities to gather those logs in a central place. Many organizations are choosing to implement Elasticsearch with Logstash and Kibana (ELK for short) over transactional databases that may struggle to scale. ELK stack Elasticsearch with Logstash and Kibana is a collection of complementary systems that gather data for later searching. Each component handles different functions: ; ; ; Elasticsearch – text searching at scale Logstash – log ingestion Kibana – an analytics engine designed to work with Elasticsearch An excellent example of the power of the ELK stack is the “Hunting ELK” distribution – created by Roberto Rodriguez. HELK includes additional features designed by and for hunters, such as support for Jupyter notebooks and various methods of performing enterprise searches. One of the most powerful implementations of HELK relies on the ability of analysts to configure custom dashboards to visualize log data – Mr. Rodriguez has helpfully provided a few on the HELK web site that display detailed summaries of network and Sysmon activity. Data Collection After an organization has chosen endpoint software for gener- ating the right data, and settled on a centralized place to collect it, the task of getting the right data to the right place takes center stage. There are many free and open source tools to help with this, such as: 60 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting ; Syslog, Syslog-NG, and Rsyslog for MacOS and Linux ; Windows Event Forwarding, NxLog, and WinLogBeat for Windows Considerations Data quality is commonly overlooked by organizations devel- oping a hunting capability. But data quality is important if hunters are meant to efficiently and effectively identify threats using it – especially if one objective is automation. To para- phrase Roberto Rodriguez, author of the HELK distribution, data must be: ; ; ; Complete – data for every necessary field Consistent – reliably accurate and complete Timely – delivered in an up-to-date manner For each type of endpoint, organizations should understand what visibility is provided to them and should adopt a scoring system for measuring those attributes. Organizations cannot fall into the seductive trap of scoring partial or undefined coverage as complete coverage – this cannot be overstated. Instead, refer to the following blog post for a scoring methodol- ogy: Ready to hunt? First, Show me your data! Appendix B A Hunt Cheat Sheet This hunt cheat sheet is a resource you can use to look up key information and ideas during your hunts. Platform @Cyb3rWard0g, https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/HELK Hardware Use an Elastic Stack to store your hunting data (DNS, Sysmon, ETW, etc.). System Requirements: OS: Ubuntu-16.04.2 Server amd64, Network: NAT/Bridge, RAM: >=4GB IPV4 header format (network hunt) DNS record (network hunt) Domain Name: google.com Updated Date: 2015-06-12… Creation Date: 1997-09-15… Ref: elastic.co, whois, docs.microsoft.com 62 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Sysmon event (host hunt) Analysis Techniques Search Searching involves using indicators of compromise to detect malicious activity. These can be file attributes (hashes, filenames, import hashes), network artifacts (domains, IP addresses), registry keys (key values, key sources), and known compromised user accounts and machines. This is a weak approach, because signatures have short life spans. Appendix B: A Hunt Cheat Sheet | 63 Frequency and outlier analysis Frequency and counts of artifacts help discover anomalies. Anomalies do not necessarily represent suspicious activity, but when used correctly they provide leads for investigation. For example, DNS request counts show the occurrences of a regis- try key, or the least occurring scheduled tasks and WMI objects in the environment. Comparative analysis Comparative analysis uses a gold or baseline image to find del- tas. The gold image is the clean slate prior to any user interac- tion. You can compare workstations to the baseline image. This is especially important if your users are unable to install new software or don’t commonly do so. Any deviation from that baseline gold image might be an anomaly worth investigating. Temporal proximity Using time can be very powerful because it relates to network and event data. For instance, small packets being sent on a routine time interval may be indicative of malware beaconing or showing Windows events in a sequential order. This can illu- minate malicious activity, e.g., process create, process execute, DNS request, network connection, process terminate, and file delete. Data enrichment Public data sources and threat intel feeds are immensely powerful for data enrichment, not for searching. For instance, you can search file attributes in VirusTotal and search network artifacts in WHOIS databases and tools like Domain Tools or Central Ops. 64 | The Endgame Guide to Threat Hunting Quick Wins How do you detect persistence techniques?

      "Tipping is terrible. It’s bad for all but the highest-paid servers. The American public seem to be increasingly disillusioned with it, too: According to a 2017 YouGov poll, 44% of Americans are in favor of doing away with tipping altogether and paying waiters higher wages instead, while 36% want the system to stay the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now residents of Washington, DC, have a chance to change the way restaurants work. On Tuesday (June 19) residents vote on Initiative 77, which would eliminate tipping in restaurants and replace it with a $15 minimum wage for servers. Currently, servers in DC get $3.33 an hour, plus tips. If the tips fall short of $12.50 an hour, restaurants make up the difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "From an economic standpoint, it’s safe to say that eliminating tipping is definitely the right move. The much harder question is how to calculate the right minimum wage to replace tips.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strange, terrible economics of tipping\n",
      "\n",
      "Most Americans think of tipping as an economic transaction between the customer and the server, in which the server is held responsible for the quality of the dining experience and rewarded or punished accordingly. This is incorrect. The service a diner receives is the product of the entire restaurant staff; a particularly efficient prep cook or bumbling dishwasher can make a big difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet tips mostly compensate the server. This distinguishes restaurants from most other businesses. In any other industry, company owners ration revenue based on the skills, scarcity, and value added of each staff member. But in American restaurants, convention and regulation, rather than economics, dictates how revenue is divided. As a result, chefs—who have specialized training and skills—earn a fraction of what servers are paid in many fine dining restaurants. Research estimates front-of-the-house staff makes 80% more than kitchen staff in fine-dining restaurants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tipping system works out great for servers in fine-dining restaurants, who can make more than $100,000 a year. But in most restaurants, servers barely get by. They also bear the risk of a slow night or a table that lingers for hours and barely orders any food. If they simply got paid a normal salary, they’d have more predictability, and be better equipped to figure out how to manage their budgets. (Under current DC law, servers have a bit more stability, since restaurant owners top up slow tip days to $12.50 an hour. But some DC employers violate that rule, and plenty of other places in the US don’t have such high minimums.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Does getting rid of tips hurt restaurants?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most restaurants in DC oppose the proposal to end tipping. That’s because restaurants typically operate on thin margins. To pay the staff higher wages, they’ll need to raise menu prices, which they worry will be bad for business.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is probably true that restaurants will be forced to raise prices—but that does not necessarily mean that all customers will actually wind up paying more for their meals. It depends on what kind of tippers they are, and the type of restaurant they frequent.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 66% of restaurant customers tip 20% or more, according to Michael Lynn, a marketing professor at Cornell University who researches tipping. If a restaurant needs to increase prices by 20% in order to pay servers at least $15 per hour, that suggests 66% of customers would be fine with the change, while the other 34% of customers could be less inclined to eat out, according to Lynn. If restaurants need to increase prices even more to pay at least $15 an hour, they stand to lose even more business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cheaper restaurants will probably have to hike up menu prices more, since smaller bills mean smaller service charges. They also have more price-sensitive customers. So it’s the lower-priced restaurants that face the most potential risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The right minimum wage\n",
      "\n",
      "And so how much damage eliminating tipping does to restaurants depends mostly on the minimum wage that replaces the tips. In the case of DC, most restaurants and servers wouldn’t see an immediate effect. The minimum wage would start at $12.50—what servers are paid now, including tips—and be phased in over the next seven years.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as the wages increased, the effects on restaurants and workers would be less certain. Profitable restaurants would probably be able to absorb higher costs; restaurants with lower margins (that is, most businesses) would need to increase prices. Whether this would mean fewer jobs is unclear. Evidence suggests higher minimum wages may reduce some teen employment. Generally, small wage increases don’t have much impact; less is known about large increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether a $2.50 increase, over a seven year period, is large or small depends on what happens to the DC economy in the next seven years. A recession, which makes customers more price-sensitive, coupled with higher server wages could be catastrophic for restaurants. A strong economy would probably mean bigger restaurant profits, and perhaps even wage increases that go beyond the minimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are alternative options that could expose restaurants to less risk, like making wage increases contingent on economic conditions. But the DC proposal is a step in the right direction: It would give equity to kitchen staff, and strike a blow against tipping tyranny.\n",

      "The American Civil Liberties Union will weigh its interest in protecting the First Amendment against its other commitments to social justice, racial equality, and women's rights, given the possibility that offensive speech might undermine ACLU goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our defense of speech may have a greater or lesser harmful impact on the equality and justice work to which we are also committed,\" wrote ACLU staffers in a confidential memo obtained by former board member Wendy Kaminer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's hard to see this as anything other than a cowardly retreat from a full-throated defense of the First Amendment. Moving forward, when deciding whether to take a free speech case, the organization will consider \"factors such as the (present and historical) context of the proposed speech; the potential effect on marginalized communities; the extent to which the speech may assist in advancing the goals of white supremacists or others whose views are contrary to our values; and the structural and power inequalities in the community in which the speech will occur.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The memo also makes clear that the ACLU has zero interest in defending First Amendment rights in conjunction with Second Amendment rights. If controversial speakers intend to carry weapons, the ACLU \"will generally not represent them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The memo's authors assert that this does not amount to a formal change in policy, and is merely intended as guidelines that will assist ACLU affiliates in deciding which cases to take.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kaminer, though, sees the memo as yet more evidence that the ACLU \"has already lost its zeal for vigorously defending the speech it hates.\" As she writes in The Wall Street Journal:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech-case guidelines reflect a demotion of free speech in the ACLU's hierarchy of values. Their vague references to the \"serious harm\" to \"marginalized\" people occasioned by speech can easily include the presumed psychological effects of racist or otherwise hateful speech, which is constitutionally protected but contrary to ACLU values. Faced with perceived conflicts between freedom of speech and \"progress toward equality,\" the ACLU is likely to choose equality. If the Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's balancing test, it would greatly expand government power to restrict speech. In Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), for example, the ACLU defended the First Amendment rights of a Ku Klux Klan leader prosecuted for addressing a small rally and calling for \"revengence\" against blacks and Jews. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed Clarence Brandenburg's conviction, narrowly defining incitement to violence as speech both intended and likely to cause imminent illegal action. Brandenburg made an essential distinction between advocacy and action, which progressives who equate hate speech with actual discrimination or violence seek to erase. The ACLU would be hard pressed to take Brandenburg's case today, given its new guidelines. The organization hasn't yet endorsed a ban on hate speech, or a broader definition of incitement. The guidelines affirm that \"speakers have a right to advocate violence.\" But even if Brandenburg managed to pass the new balancing test for speech cases, some participants at his rally were armed, and, according to the guidelines, \"the ACLU generally will not represent protesters who seek to march while armed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kaminer notes that the ACLU is of course free to change its position on free speech—but it should own up to this evolution:\n",
      "\n",
      "All this is the ACLU's prerogative. Organizations are entitled to revise their values and missions. But they ought to do so openly. The ACLU leadership had apparently hoped to keep its new guidelines secret, even from ACLU members. They're contained in an internal document deceptively marked, in all caps, \"confidential attorney client work product.\" I'm told it was distributed to select ACLU officials and board members, who were instructed not to share it. According to my source, the leadership is now investigating the \"leak\" of its new case-selection guidelines. President Trump might sympathize.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems fairly clear to me what's happening here. Leadership would probably like the ACLU to remain a pro-First Amendment organization, but they would also like to remain in good standing with their progressive allies. Unfortunately, young progressives are increasingly hostile to free speech, which they view as synonymous with racist hate speech. Speech that impugns marginalized persons is not speech at all, in their view, but violence. This is why a student Black Lives Matter group shut down an ACLU event at the College of William & Mary last year, chanting \"liberalism is white supremacy\" and \"the revolution will not uphold the Constitution.\" Campus activism is illiberal, and liberal free speech norms conflict with the broad protection of emotional comfort that the young, modern left demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ACLU's capitulation to the anti-speech left should serve as a wake up call for true liberals. What has taken place on campus over the last decade does matter, and though the scope of the problem is frequently overstated, we should all be concerned when the nation's premiere civil liberties organization is increasingly afraid of defending the First Amendment—not because the Trump administration scares them, but because college students do.\n",

      "\n",
      "Of course, combatting abuse and bullying will remain Twitter’s most pressing area of concern – especially as it’s the place where President Trump tweets, and the daily news is reported and discussed (and angrily fought about).\n",

      "From ensuring safety and security at some of the world’s largest companies to specialized domain expertise, Smyte’s years of experience with these issues brings valuable insight to our team. The Smyte team has dealt with many unique issues facing online safety and believes in the same proactive approach that we’re taking for Twitter: stopping abusive behavior before it impacts anyone’s experience. We can’t wait until they join our team to help us make changes that will further improve the health of the public conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Smyte’s website, the company has a number of high-profile clients, including Indiegogo, GoFundMe, npm, Musical.ly, TaskRabbit, Meetup, OLX, ThredUp, YouNow, 99 Designs, Carousell, and Zendesk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twitter tells us that Smyte will wind down its operations with those customers – it didn’t acquire Smyte for its revenue-generation potential, but rather for its talent and IP. [See update on that transition, detailed below post.]\n",
      "\n",
      "LinkedIn reports there are only a couple dozen employees at Smyte today, including the founders. But Smtye’s own website lists just nineteen. Twitter wouldn’t confirm Smtye’s current headcount but says it’s working to find positions for all.\n",

      "\n",
      "Twitter had told us Smyte had a transition plan for existing customers. However, it did not – or Twitter believes that “transition plan” means phoning customers to explain why the API is now shut off. We understand that those affected, some of whom are being matched with new providers today, were given no warning about Smyte’s closure. Instead, they found their access was just gone.\n",

      "\n",
      "»Trust and safety as a service«, they said. Now @Twitter owns @HelloSmyte, and trust is down the drain.

      "Phone service after a disaster is imperative and AT&T and Verizon are using drones that will help 4:31 PM ET Fri, 24 Aug 2018 | 01:53\n",
      "\n",
      "Hurricane season is here, and having phone service following a natural disaster can mean the difference between life and death. AT&T and Verizon are using drones that could help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verizon has been testing a 200-pound gas-powered drone in Cape May County, New Jersey. The drone acts as a flying cell site and provides a 4G LTE signal throughout a one mile range.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The ability to bring coverage to an area that had no coverage really quickly is something that emergency responders are all over, \" says Verizon Network Vice President Michael Haberman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could you imagine if you'd be able to bring drones through an area, and you can cover a mile, which is a pretty big area, and all of the sudden the user, who most have smartphones, can actually use their smartphone product and call for help and help us identify where they are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a report by the FCC, 90 percent of the cell sites in Puerto Rico were down after Hurricane Maria hit the region last year. Shortly after, the FCC granted AT&T permission to use its Cell On Wings (COW) drone to restore cellular service to the area. At that time, AT&T opened cellphone access to everyone, not just customers, so that anyone in the area could get service. AT&T says its operational model is build around drones as a service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We would provide our flying COW to the first responders, to, say the fire department, and we would pilot it for them,\" says AT&T Drone Program Director, Art Pregler. \"So all it takes is for them to place a phone call, email, contact us and we'll provide that service.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verizon's drones are still in the testing phase, but Haberman says they will be available to use in the case of a natural disaster this year.\n",

      "Everyone has stressful days at work. But for some employees, it’s not just once in a while when Monday rolls around; instead, stress is their daily reality. Over time, this can lead to full-on employee burnout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burnout is especially common in the fast-paced, competitive environment of the tech industry. But how common is it, what are the consequences, why should we care and what can employers do to de-stress their workforce?\n",
      "\n",
      "How Common Is Employee Burnout?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the question that Blind—a workplace app for tech employees—set out to answer through a user survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app is used by 40,000 Microsoft employees, 25,000 from Amazon, 10,000 from Google, 7,000 from Uber, 6,000 from Facebook, and thousands from other tech companies, so there is wide representation in their survey results.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one-question survey had a simple yes/no answer: “Are you currently suffering from job burnout?”\n",
      "\n",
      "And over half of respondents (57.16%, to be exact) answered yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some companies had more burnout than others in the survey. Credit Karma had the highest rate, with over 70% of employees saying they were burnt out. Netflix was the lowest at around 39%.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the best company in the survey still has a nearly 40% burnt-out workforce…the tech industry might have a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Is Causing Employee Burnout?\n",
      "\n",
      "A survey by Kronos found three top-cited factors for workplace burnout: unfair compensation (41%), an unreasonable workload (32%), and too much overtime work (32%). Other common factors included poor management, negative workplace culture, and employees feeling disconnected from the company strategy in their roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of these factors are controllable if companies are honest and proactive about the issue (discussed in greater detail later on).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Consequences of Burnout\n",
      "\n",
      "Burnout has serious consequences on both the micro and macro levels. In healthcare spending alone, workplace stress costs $125 to $190 billion annually. It contributes to around 120,000 deaths per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stress is also responsible for higher rates of quitting or job-changing among employees: 95% of HR leaders agreed in the Kronos survey that burnout was sabotaging workforce retention.\n",
      "\n",
      "James Campbell Quick, Ph.D., has produced much research regarding occupational stress and burnout, examining it from both the individual and organizational levels. He emphasizes that there are also financial consequences for companies who ignore the mental health of their workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are huge, if sometimes hard to calculate, financial costs associated with poor mental health at work,” Quick says. “The US Air Force HR team at one logistics depot of 13,000 employees estimated that there were over $33 million in costs avoided because the commanding general had hired a full-time psychologist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Why We Should All Care About Employees’ Mental Health\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than the utilitarian financial reasons, Quick adds, there’s a “moral or humanitarian” component. “People are intrinsically important.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lynn Hamilton, Chief Commercial Officer at online therapy company Talkspace, says, “Roughly one in five people have a diagnosable mental health condition, and these numbers run parallel in the workplace. Yet, the vast majority of people either don’t seek treatment, are misdiagnosed or don’t get the adequate treatment they need.”\n",
      "\n",
      "You may know these employees, work with them, or be one yourself. It’s an important issue to care about because the ripple effects are wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it’s certainly worth caring about on the institutional level as well. Business psychologist and psychotherapist Douglas Labier, Ph.D., has dedicated decades to studying the connection between people’s work and their mental/emotional health, and working personally with those affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why is it important for companies to care about employees’ mental health?” asks Labier. “That’s like growing a vegetable garden and then asking why it’s important to provide water and adequate sunlight. A company has the objective of a productive, profitable and sustainable business, and the mental health of employees is central to that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What Companies Can Do To Reduce Stress In The Workplace\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several steps that companies can take to reduce the impact of burnout on their employees. It all starts with figuring out what the most common sources of burnout are for their own employees since every company is different. From there, they can pursue the following strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acknowledge that the problem exists. “Employee burnout is real, and all are at risk for this problem,” says Quick. “Early intervention is best, so as employees reach a yellow zone for burnout, that’s the time to make referrals or maybe turn down the pressure put on them and the pressure they self-generate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Create a work environment where employees feel listened to, empowered, and appreciated on a daily basis. Labier suggests that this begins with management culture: “Exclude toxic, arrogant, and narcissistic bosses. Promote collaboration, support for learning and development, a fair reward system, transparency, promotion of diversity, etc.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Emphasize wellness initiatives that focus on both physical and mental health. A good healthcare plan, healthy food provided on site, and covered gym/yoga memberships are good examples. Employers can also do things like pay for meditation apps or sessions for employees and provide quiet rooms where employees can do a mental reset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Offer a flexible working environment: for instance, allow employees to choose their own hours, work from home when needed, and take time off regularly. “Ensure that people have time off, respites from work, and emotional support on the job,” says Quick. “Burnout results from working or striving for too long and/or with too much effort and energy expenditure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Encourage non-work activities. “Burnout is best prevented when people have things that excite them, energize them, and bring them renewals…whatever that is.” explains Quick. “Encourage employees to have non-work interests and activities that offer balance and alternative sources of renewal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Provide access to counseling resources, whether in person or online. According to Hamilton, online therapy programs like Talkspace “eliminate the biggest barriers to therapy; access, convenience, and stigma.” Either way, she says, effective therapy should have “an ongoing, personal 1:1 relationship between therapist and client, treatment planning, goal setting, and measuring outcomes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing employee stress and burnout, companies can improve on a financial, operational, and even human level. “Companies that offer a variety of options for mental healthcare are making an investment in their workforce,” concludes Hamilton. “Dividends are paid in the form of higher retention, lower overall total medical costs, and a more productive workforce.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which oversees Kubernetes, requires vendors to go through a certification process in order to offer a managed service using the project, and AWS announced Tuesday that Amazon EKS is now “Kubernetes conformant,” not that anybody was really worried about passing the test. Kubernetes users have been running the software themselves on AWS for a long time, but the addition of a managed service gives AWS customers a little more help dealing with Kubernetes, and brings AWS into parity with Microsoft and Google on this front.\n",
      "\n",
      "AWS cited CNCF data that 57 percent of Kubernetes users are running the software on AWS, compared to 33 percent who are running it on Google Cloud (where it was originally developed) and 16 percent on Microsoft Azure. The numbers add up to more than 100 percent because an increasing number of people are using Kubernetes to manage deployments across multiple public clouds or between public clouds and on-premises data centers, as travel giant Sabre has begun to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon EKS rolled out today to the usual opening regions for a new service: US East in Northern Virginia and US West in Oregon. More regions are coming “very soon,” according to an AWS blog post, and the company also plans to announce new features for the service later this year, with re:Invent 2018 in late November a likely venue.\n",

As the communications landscape continues to change over, we're focusing on building and introducing new, exciting communications tools that better fit consumer needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yahoo today announced that its Yahoo Messenger service will no longer be supported after July 17, 2018, encompassing the closure of apps for iOS and Android and any web browser clients (via TechCrunch ). The service will function normally until then, and after that date users will no longer be able to access their chats and the Messenger service as a whole will be shut down.The company promised that the discontinuation of Yahoo Messenger will not impact a user's Yahoo ID, so it will continue to work for products like Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Fantasy. As for a reason, Yahoo said that it is focusing on \"building and introducing new, exciting communications tools\" that will be a \"better fit\" for its customers.\"There currently isn't a replacement\" for Yahoo Messenger, however, so the company pointed users toward the invite-only group messaging app Yahoo Squirrel . Squirrel is still in the testing phase and allows groups to organize private chats with friends and family members in a style similar to Slack and Discord.Yahoo originally debuted its Yahoo Messenger app on the iOS App Store [ Direct Link ] in April 2009 , giving users the ability to instant message their contacts when away from their computer. In the years since, messaging apps like Apple's iMessage, Facebook Messenger, and others have surged in popularity and caused users to leave Yahoo's platform for ones more popular among their own friend groups. Today, Yahoo Messenger is #167 on the App Store's most-downloaded Social Networking app list.Prior to its appearance on the App Store, Yahoo Messenger originally debuted in 1998 (dubbed \"Yahoo Pager\") as an instant messaging client that users could download for free to chat with friends. In 2018, Yahoo said that users will be able to download their chat history to a computer or other device for the next six months, and more information can be found in the FAQ section of the announcement page.Yahoo Messenger's closure in 2018 follows the sunsetting of AOL Instant Messenger in December 2017, both of which are owned by parent company Oath and lasted for around 20 years online.\n",

      "And only about half the people who died by suicide had a known mental health condition, even though depression had been thought to be the major cause of suicide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n",
      "\n",
      "While many cases of mental illness may have been diagnosed, the CDC also noted that relationship stress, financial troubles and substance abuse were contributing to the trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suicide rates in the United States have risen nearly 30 percent since 1999, and mental health conditions are one of several factors contributing to suicide,\" the CDC researchers wrote in their report.\n",

      "The suicide of fashion designer Kate Spade, who died this week at age 55, and the death of celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain , are capturing headlines and making people wonder if certain groups, such as middle-aged men and women, may be more at risk. They are.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Middle-aged adults had the largest number of suicides and a particularly high increase in suicide rates. These findings are disturbing,\" said CDC principal deputy director Dr. Anne Schuchat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the CDC team found almost no group is exempt from the rise in suicide rates, except people over age 75.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly 45,000 people died by suicide in 2016, the CDC team found.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What we tried to do in this study was look at the state level at trends over time,” Schuchat said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unfortunately, the suicide rates went up more than 30 percent in half of the states.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Suicide rates have increased in every state since 1999 with the exception of Nevada — but Nevada has already long had one of the highest suicide rates in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A key thing that we focused on was looking at individuals who committed suicide, comparing those with mental health diagnoses with those who didn’t,” Schuchat told NBC News.\n",
      "\n",
      "“More than half of all the individuals who committed suicide had no mental health diagnoses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That may be in part because it’s so difficult to get mental health care, said Dr. Jack Rozel, medical director of the Allegheny crisis services facility in Pittsburgh and president-elect of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I run a major crisis center. We have 150 staff. We provide almost 150,000 services every year,” Rozel, also a psychiatry professor at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even his team sometimes has problems finding help for people.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I am reasonably well-connected. About a year ago a friend of mine reached out to me. He was feeling more sad, more anxious, than usual,\" Rozel said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It took me days to get him an appointment with someone. It’s a problem.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when people do have treatment, Rozel said, it may be difficult to find the right approach and to find the time and money to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first medication doesn’t always work. Sometimes you have to find a second or a third. Or a therapist — for whatever reason you don’t connect, you don’t link. It puts people in a very tough spot,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there’s more to the trends than simply mental health issues, said Schuchat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been learning as a nation we have seen increases and decreases over time in suicide,” she said. “Increases mostly seem to correlate with economic downturns.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Suicide rates increased the most in some Western and Midwestern states, including Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, North and South Dakota and Minnesota, as well as Kansas and Oklahoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those are generally rural states,” Schuchat noted. “We know the economic downturn hit rural states hard and the recovery sometimes takes longer in some of those rural communities. We also know in rural states that access to care may be harder.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Firearms were the most common method used. They were used in nearly half of all suicides and in 55 percent of the cases where there was no known mental health condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CDC team dug into more details in 27 states. When details were available on what may have been factors in suicides, the CDC team found:\n",
      "\n",
      "42 percent had a relationship problem\n",
      "\n",
      "28 percent had substance abuse issues\n",

      "The FBI is advising users of consumer-grade routers and network-attached storage devices to reboot them as soon as possible to counter Russian-engineered malware that has infected hundreds of thousands devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers from Cisco’s Talos security team first disclosed the existence of the malware on Wednesday. The detailed report said the malware infected more than 500,000 devices made by Linksys, Mikrotik, Netgear, QNAP, and TP-Link. Known as VPNFilter, the malware allowed attackers to collect communications, launch attacks on others, and permanently destroy the devices with a single command. The report said the malware was developed by hackers working for an advanced nation, possibly Russia, and advised users of affected router models to perform a factory reset, or at a minimum to reboot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limited persistence\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the day, The Daily Beast reported that VPNFilter was indeed developed by a Russian hacking group , one known by a variety of names, including Sofacy, Fancy Bear, APT 28, and Pawn Storm. The Daily Beast also said the FBI had seized an Internet domain VPNFilter used as a backup means to deliver later stages of the malware to devices that were already infected with the initial stage 1. The seizure meant that the primary and secondary means to deliver stages 2 and 3 had been dismantled, leaving only a third fallback, which relied on attackers sending special packets to each infected device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The redundant mechanisms for delivering the later stages address a fundamental shortcoming in VPNFilter—stages 2 and 3 can’t survive a reboot, meaning they are wiped clean as soon as a device is restarted. Instead, only stage 1 remains. Presumably, once an infected device reboots, stage 1 will cause it to reach out to the recently seized ToKnowAll.com address. The FBI’s advice to reboot small office and home office routers and NAS devices capitalizes on this limitation. In a statement published Friday, FBI officials suggested that users of all consumer-grade routers, not just those known to be vulnerable to VPNFilter, protect themselves. The officials wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "The FBI recommends any owner of small office and home office routers reboot the devices to temporarily disrupt the malware and aid the potential identification of infected devices. Owners are advised to consider disabling remote management settings on devices and secure with strong passwords and encryption when enabled. Network devices should be upgraded to the latest available versions of firmware.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement also published Friday, Justice Department officials wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "Owners of SOHO and NAS devices that may be infected should reboot their devices as soon as possible, temporarily eliminating the second stage malware and causing the first stage malware on their device to call out for instructions. Although devices will remain vulnerable to reinfection with the second stage malware while connected to the Internet, these efforts maximize opportunities to identify and remediate the infection worldwide in the time available before Sofacy actors learn of the vulnerability in their command-and-control infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US Department of Homeland Security has also issued a statement advising that \"all SOHO router owners power cycle (reboot) their devices to temporarily disrupt the malware.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted in the statements, rebooting serves the objectives of (1) temporarily preventing infected devices from running the stages that collect data and other advanced attacks and (2) helping FBI officials to track who was infected. Friday’s statement said the FBI is working with the non-profit Shadow Foundation to disseminate the IP addresses of infected devices to ISPs and foreign authorities to notify end users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities and researchers still don’t know for certain how compromised devices are initially infected. They suspect the attackers exploited known vulnerabilities and default passwords that end users had yet to patch or change. That uncertainty is likely driving the advice in the FBI statement that all router and NAS users reboot, rather than only users of the 14 models known to be affected by VPNFilter, which are:\n",

      "The advice to reboot, update, change default passwords, and disable remote administration is sound and in most cases requires no more than 15 minutes. Of course, a more effective measure is to follow the advice Cisco gave Wednesday to users of affected devices and perform a factory reset, which will permanently remove all of the malware, including stage 1. This generally involves using a paper clip or thumb tack to hold down a button on the back of the device for 5 seconds. The reset will remove any configuration settings stored on the device, so users will have to restore those settings once the device initially reboots. (It's never a bad idea to disable UPnP when practical, but that protection appears to have no effect on VPNFilter.)\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no easy way to know if a router has been infected by VPNFilter. For more advanced users, Cisco provided detailed indicators of compromise in Wednesday’s report, along with firewall rules that can be used to protect devices. Ars has much more about VPNFilter here.\n",

      "As I write about in the philosophy of Westworld, life is really about meaning loops. They’re the structures that make us want to strive and improve, and that make life matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody has them.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some people it’s raising kids and being a good parent. For others it’s about becoming famous for their work. Others want to make some sort of impact on the world. Different people want to be revered or feared, respected or admired.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whatever that thing is, that thing that you’re pursuing, it is the framework that evolution is using to inspire you to improve. Evolution needs this because it wants (not really) to have the best possible outcomes, so it figures out what the game is in any particular context, and then makes winning that game the shiniest thing possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why someone can hate country music and big trucks, but if they move to south Florida in their early 20’s they’ll probably soon like them. Evolution makes us like, and want to be successful within, the culture that surrounds us. So we quickly take on the preferences of those around us so that we can be a successful competitor in that environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe human brains are only set up to have one meaning loop at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many years back I wrote about the potential dangers of role-playing, where I talked about this exact thing but without collapsing it down to an evolutionary pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "My takeaway was that you can’t maintain two striving contexts simultaneously, and that role-playing is extremely good at recreating entire realities—and thus striving contexts as well. So you basically have to decide which context you care about and go all-in with it. That’s the only way to keep your brain happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Switching contexts is really hard, which is why a lot of my role-playing friends say they experience depression when a major campaign ends. It’s because it causes their brain to struggle for a meaning infrastructure, and until you find the next one you can’t be happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this is also why people are depressed in general—not having such a structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "And of course that’s why role-playing is so attractive to many: it provides a way to achieve greatly within a fully-contained infrastructure and thus receive the pleasure rewards that evolution grants us when we succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Role-playing, and other types of immersive games, are basically tricking evolution into thinking that we’re successful so that evolution (through the brain) will give us pleasurable feelings of achievement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seems kind of pathetic when you put it that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, evolution normally reserves this sort of pleasure for people who crush their enemies and protect their families and do all sorts of real survival stuff in the face of mortal danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s now possible to play games that are so good that it tricks our brains into thinking we did the same things, and thus deserve the same rewards. It’s a clean way of seeing why people like to game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, the point here is that evolution forces our brains to tune to an environment, figures out what would get us reproductive success in that setting, and then rewards us for achieving those things.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it can only tune to one environment at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you’re a career person, or a parent, or an avid role-player, and you’re trying to do all these things at the same time, they might compete for being your primary meaning infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being a career person and a great parent often doesn’t compete (for men) because they see their career as helping their children. For women it’s harder because they feel that the kids lose more by them not being there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think people who have the clearest, single-focused infrastructures are the people who are the happiest because the rules are most visible, the brain knows what to do to win, and it rewards you when you hit certain milestones. Just like back when we were competing with animals and weather to survive.\n",
      "\n",
      "So try not to mix your meaning loops. The human mind isn’t good at it.\n",

      "Amazon has sold cheap facial-recognition software to law enforcement agencies in at least two states and has also sold it to a police body camera manufacturer and a company that does intelligence and data analysis for law enforcement, according to internal documents at those police departments and Amazon’s own marketing materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The software, created by Amazon Web Services, is called “Amazon Rekognition” and promises to “perform real-time recognition of persons of interest from camera live streams against your private database of face metadata,” according to the company’s marketing materials. The software uses image recognition algorithms to track and identify objects in people when tested against an existing database of videos or photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "The software was created last year, but new documents obtained using freedom of information requests by the American Civil Liberties Union shows how it’s currently being used by police, how they hope to use it in the future, and reveal that federal data fusion centers are interested in the technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "These law enforcement uses of Rekognition signal that Amazon, one of the world’s most powerful companies, has entered the law enforcement surveillance market in earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the company’s AWS Summit in Seoul, South Korea last month, Ranju Das, the director of Rekognition, said that the Orlando, Florida police department is a “launch partner” for the technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a smart city, they have cameras all over the city,” Das said. “The authorized cameras are then streaming the data to [Amazon] … we analyze the video in real time, search against the collection of faces that they have,” he said, adding that the technology could be used to track the whereabouts of the city’s major and “persons of interest” and that the system could send real-time alerts to the police.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesperson for the Orlando Police Department told me that it is only piloting the technology and that it “is not using the technology in an investigative capacity or in any public spaces at this time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rekognition website and its partnership with police body camera manufacturer Body Worn suggest that Amazon and law enforcement have interest in identifying people in real time while in the field. It’s worth noting that Amazon has changed an example use case on its website from “Example: Public safety - law enforcement body cams” to “Example: Finding missing persons on social media.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Amazon also says it sells the software to Data Fusion Systems, a company whose “goal is to provide actionable intelligence to authorities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Amazon’s marketing materials read like a user manual for authoritarian surveillance,” Matt Cagle, a technology and civil liberties attorney at the ACLU of Northern California, told me on a phone call. “Amazon has recommended Rekognition for officer body cameras, which would transform them from a tool for officer accountability into surveillance machines pointed at the public.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesperson for AWS told me in an emailed statement that “Amazon requires that customers comply with the law and be responsible when they use AWS services. When we find that AWS services are being abused by a customer, we suspend that customer’s right to use our services.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rekognition in use\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t a secret that police departments were interested and had purchased this technology—local news reports in Washington County, Oregon, showed that the sheriff’s office there purchased and is using the technology; Orlando’s interest has also been previously reported, and Amazon advertises both cities as customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, emails, presentations, contracts, and other Rekognition-related documents obtained by the ACLU from the two departments show that the software is inexpensive and already has interest from federal data fusion centers, which aggregate data across jurisdictions and departments and are seen as a nightmare for civil liberties.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is all happening at a time when public protest is at an all-time high and the federal government is attacking immigrants and labeling black activists as criminals,” Cagle said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Washington County documents show that the department spent $400 to upload a database of 305,000 mugshot photos dating back to 2001 to Amazon’s servers. It pays roughly $6 per month to use the software, which matches that database against people who are suspected of committing crimes: “We only use it when we’re investigating criminal activity when we have a suspect in a crime,” Jeff Talbot, a public information officer for the department, told me on the phone. “We are not using it to surveil people or doing real-time surveillance … there have been discussions and we’ve drafted policies to prohibit anything further than what we are doing right now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are not trying to hide that we’re doing this, we are proud of this software,” Talbot added. “It’s finding innovative ways to keep people in our community safe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A training slide shows that the technology doesn't always work.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a training presentation obtained by the ACLU shows that the service can have false positives. A slide in the presentation showed an instance where someone was identified as a 94.66 percent match against an existing photo, but wasn’t the correct person. Another slide shows an image of OJ Simpson was a 95.53 percent match with a white man with a mustache and long white hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am hoping to expand our backend of images to every law enforcement agency in the metro Portland area. And possibly even to all of Oregon and beyond,” Chris Adzima, a senior informations systems analyst for the Washington County Sheriff wrote in an email to Amazon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adzima wrote a testimonial blog post for Amazon in June, 2017 in which he said he used the software to identify a man who had shoplifted from a hardware store based on the store’s surveillance footage. Emails sent between Adzima and Amazon show that Amazon coached Adzima in writing that blog post.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We shifted the narrative voice within the walk-through from I to We,” an Amazon employee wrote to him in one email about the blog post. “This was at the request of the account team that didn’t want to make it sound like you’re a lone wolf programmer working on AWS (it might be true, but that’s not the impression they want.)”\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon also asked the department to sign a nondisclosure agreement about Rekognition, which is a common practice in the surveillance tech industry. For example, Harris Corp. requires law enforcement agencies to sign NDAs for its cell-site simulator StingRay technology, which is widely used by police to track cell phones. Washington County didn’t sign Amazon’s NDA right away, and an Amazon employee followed up with Adzima several times; Adzima eventually assured the employee that he would make sure it got signed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sounds good to me!,” the employee responded. “The squeaky wheel gets the NDA.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cagle said that “the public has a right to know when law enforcement agencies are seeking to acquire or use surveillance technology, which includes facial recognition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The emails also show that an official with the Oregon TITAN Fusion Center reached out to Adzima after Government Technology magazine wrote an article about Rekognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was wondering is there a possibility of the Fusion Center and the Watch Center running photos through you guys?” the official wrote. “As far as I know you guys are the first to embrace this technology on the LE [law enforcement] level.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fusion centers were started soon after 9/11 as a means of aggregating local, state, federal, and private-sector data. The data can come from traffic records, schools, ISPs and telecom companies, banks, public records, law enforcement, and more. According to its website, the Oregon TITAN Fusion Center is run by “the Oregon Department of Justice, Oregon State Police, Oregon State Sheriff’s Association, the Oregon Association of Chiefs of Police, Oregon District Attorney’s Association, Department of Homeland Security, Salem Police Department, and the FBI.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rekognition currently runs images and video against only images that individual law enforcement agencies upload to their own AWS clouds, but if fusion centers were to upload their own aggregated data to AWS cloud services, the power and breadth of its matching database would far exceed that of any individual police department.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ACLU and dozens of other civil liberties groups—including Human Rights Watch, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, Muslim Justice League, WITNESS, Demand Progress Action, and CAIR—wrote a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos urging him to stop selling Rekognition to law enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People should be free to walk down the street without being watched by the government,” the letter says. “Facial recognition in American communities threatens this freedom. In overpoliced communities of color, it could effectively eliminate it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon, for its part, said that it is proud of Rekognition and believes that it makes the world a better place, saying that the technology could be used to help identify missing persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As a technology, Amazon Rekognition has many useful applications in the real world (e.g. various agencies have used Rekognition to find abducted people, amusement parks use Rekognition to find lost children, the Royal Wedding that just occurred this past weekend used Rekognition to identify wedding attendees, etc.),” the company said. “Our quality of life would be much worse today if we outlawed new technology because some people could choose to abuse the technology. Imagine if customers couldn’t buy a computer because it was possible to use that computer for illegal purposes?”\n",

      "\n",
      "So just what does Gates read? Quartz manually compiled all 185 of the books recommended on his blog, which dates back to January 2010, and organized them by topic.

      "Gates reads little fiction, as he readily admits, but will dabble in YA, comedic memoir, and graphic novels on occasion. As the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, he is wont to recommend books on development, poverty, disease, and education on his blog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gates, of course, reads books on scientific topics like biology and physics, but he’s also a big fan of books that offer a scientific or mathematical framework for seeing the world, like What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions, by xkcd’s Randall Munroe. Many of the books Gates endorses, especially those that focus on the long arc of human civilization, both its past and future, argue for an optimistic outlook. Factfulness: Ten Reasons We’re Wrong about the World—and Why Things Are Better than You Think, a book by the late Hans Rosling, his son, and his daughter-in-law, does both: It argues for an optimism about the world through principles of sound scientific thinking, and it got a strong endorsement from Gates this year.\n",

      "The internet is supposed to be a place that fosters community and conversation—but all too often, it's a place where people are subjected to hateful speech and online harassment. More than 40 percent of Americans have personally experienced some degree of online harassment, and in 2017, 27 percent reported that they wouldn’t post a comment after witnessing harassment posted online. Meanwhile, the sheer volume of toxic commentary online has been enough to force prominent news organizations to shut down comments sections on their articles entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The New York Times, however, refuses to let the trolls win. They’ve invested significant resources in community moderation to ensure that their readers have a productive place to discuss all sides of an issue and connect freely over the topics that matter most, without being subjected to abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "But those high standards are hard to scale. Careful moderation takes time, and in 2016 The New York Times was only able to enable comments on about 10 percent of articles. Eager to find a solution that would let them support comments across a greater swath of articles, they looked to machine learning to help.\n",
      "\n",
      "They turned to Perspective, a free tool developed by Jigsaw and Google that uses machine learning to make it easier to host good conversations online. Perspective finds patterns in data to spot abusive language or online harassment, and it scores comments based on the perceived impact they might have on a conversation. Publishers can use that information to give real-time feedback to commenters and help human moderators sort comments more quickly. And that means news organizations and content publishers can grow their comment sections instead of turning them off, and can provide their readers with a better, more engaging community forum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using Perspective, The New York Times was able to triple the number of articles on which they offer comments, and now have comments enabled for all top stories on their homepage.\n",
      "\n",
      "We hope more organizations consider using Perspective to help host better conversations, expand dialogue on important issues, and keep our digital town squares open. To learn more about Perspective, visit https://www.perspectiveapi.com\n",

The company is said to be planning to announce the new functionality \"next month,\" suggesting it will come at WWDC as part of the iOS 12 unveiling.The Information reported nearly four years ago that Apple was looking to expand NFC capabilities to building security and transit ticketing, working with its campus security vendor HID Global on the technology.Today's report notes that while Bluetooth is already used to manage some smart locks using iPhones, NFC offers a more secure method for connections and authentication, an important consideration for companies and government agencies in particular.\n",

      "On an average day, Kristie Reeves-Cavaliero didn’t need to set an alarm clock. Her hungry one-year-old daughter Sophia Rayne “Ray Ray” Cavaliero was more than enough to get her out of bed at 5 a.m.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the day Ray Ray died, the infant slept through her usual early-morning feeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I glanced at the clock, and it was flashing ‘9:43,’ and the whole household was late,” Reeves-Cavaliero told NBC News. “It was totally chaotic.”\n",

      "The tragedy of Ray Ray’s death is experienced by the parents of an average 37 children each year. Most parents believe forgetting their child in a car is something that will never happen to them until it does, according to Dr. David Diamond, a professor of psychology at the University of South Florida.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diamond has studied the science behind the phenomenon of children forgotten in cars, and the power-struggle that can occur in all human brains when it comes to memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Competing Parts of the Brain\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, Diamond called the phenomenon “Forgotten Baby Syndrome,” which he told NBC News was a term coined by the media. After witnessing the ridicule parents experienced when assigned this term, he said he no longer uses the terminology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The principles, however, remain unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We all experience when we have a plan to do something in the future and then we forget to complete that plan,” Diamond said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said this is where several competing factors in the brain come into play. The first component is the basal ganglia, the brain center, which operates on a subconscious level. Diamond said it’s this part of the brain that stores the ability to ride a bicycle and allows people to “go on autopilot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any person is capable of forgetting a child in a car.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The basal ganglia works independently of the hippocampus, which is the part of the brain that has to do with conscious awareness and new information. The hippocampus and the frontal cortex work together to plan future activities and events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diamond uses a tennis match to explain how the three pieces of the brain can work in perfect harmony.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basal ganglia allows a tennis player to hit the ball in an almost reflexive way, while the hippocampus and the frontal cortex allow the player to devise a strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is where the systems compete against each other,” Diamond said. “In the case of you driving home, your basal ganglia wants to get you from Point A to Point B to the point it can suppress your hippocampus. [People] say you can forget to stop at the store, but you don’t forget your child is in the car. I get that feeling completely. I get that argument, but you can’t argue with brain function.”\n",
      "\n",
      "'Any Person is Capable of Forgetting a Child'\n",
      "\n",
      "Diamond has interviewed several parents whose children have died after being left in cars, and he said he often sees a pattern in the stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you drive home and don’t normally take a child to daycare, when you have a habit and you are normally driving home from work — and in those subsets or maybe none at all take a child home — well, what happens in all these cases, the parent goes into autopilot mode, which is typically from home to work. It’s in that subset of cases the basal ganglia is taking you on a route that does not include a child,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In these cases, Diamond said, the child is quiet and out of sight, which causes the parent to lose awareness of the task they’re out to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The twist is, they did not stop at daycare on the way but brain creates false memory the child was at daycare,” Diamond said. “If the child isn’t in the car that child must be where the child belongs, and the parents go to work with absolute certainty the child is safe.”\n",

      "He said the brain will fill in the gaps, and the importance of the forgotten person or item doesn’t matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I try to get across to people is it’s not about the importance of the item. It’s about a dynamic brain system that can take things as trivial as a cup I left on my car,” Diamond sad. “And it goes to tragic memory failures such as leaving dogs in cars and leaving children in cars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to forgetting a child in the car, it’s all about routines and breaks in those routines that can prove fatal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Any person is capable of forgetting a child in a car under circumstances where a parent is going through a routine and the child is in the back,” Diamond said. “All those components, if they come into play, a child can die.”\n",

      "Preventing Future Hot Car Deaths\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 1994, 804 children have died from heat-related illnesses in cars in the United States, according to Kids and Cars, an advocacy center that conducts research on car-related dangers surrounding children.\n",
      "\n",
      "In approximately 55 percent of those cases, the parent was unaware the child was in the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Texas leads the nation in child hot car deaths, and just last week four children died in the state. In one case a 7-month-old died after his father forgot he was in the car. In another, a 3-year-old died after he hid in an unlocked car and couldn’t get out. The four deaths bring the 2017 country-wide total to 16.\n",
      "\n",
      "“First and foremost the No. 1 thing parents need to know is this can happen to them,” Amber Andreasen, director Kids and Cars, told NBC News.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heat waves distort the appearance of a car as a heat wave spreads across Death Valley National Park, California in June 30, 2013. David McNew / Getty Images file\n",
      "\n",
      "While Andreasen suggested using a phone app that helps alert a parent to a child in the car, putting a shoe or a briefcase in the backseat or making sure a parent opens the backdoor and trunk at every stop, Kids and Cars is hoping Congress will soon implement mandatory regulations in all America passenger cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hot Cars Act of 2017 seeks to install visual and auditory cues in cars to signal to a parent when a child is in the backseat before the driver exits the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The reason this is so important is because parents just can’t wrap their head around the fact that this could happen to them,” Andreasen said. “They think, ‘How could I forget them? They’re the most important thing in my life.’ To prevent this from happening there has to be something automatic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Andreasen said Kids and Cars is still working to build support for the act, but said the technology is already in many cars in the United States in the form of seat belt sensors and inventors have contacted the organization offering to help develop technology if the need arises.\n",

      "When she was pregnant, Reeves-Cavaliero said she and her husband were ultra-cautious as they prepared for Ray Ray to arrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We took every single class while I was pregnant,” Reeves-Cavaliero said. “I took every single parenting class, and in every class it talks about car seats but in none of these classes do they mention [hot car deaths].”\n",
      "\n",
      "She said she had never heard of parents accidentally leaving their children in cars, and said she had always assumed when she heard stories that the parent had deliberately left their kids in the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reeves-Cavaliero has now made it her life’s mission to prevent other parents from experiencing a similar tragedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "After starting Ray Ray’s Pledge, an advocacy group to prevent hot car deaths, Reeves-Cavaliero has become a public speaker and activist, working to make sure parents know a simple change in routine can prove fatal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s just commonly misunderstood,” Reeves-Cavaliero said. “Neither of us knew it was a possibility. We would have never intentionally left our child in the car.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Beijing is slowly shedding its image as the world’s most polluted city. In 2013, it ranked as the 40th worst city for the particulate PM2.5 in the World Health Organisation global database. Four years on, thanks in part to a crackdown on polluters, it stands in 187th place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Air pollution in the 62 Chinese cities tracked by the WHO dropped by an average of 30% between 2013 and 2016. China’s air pollution problems are often blamed on the country’s rapid industrial growth but the problems probably date back to the 1950s.\n",

      "China tops WHO list for deadly outdoor air pollution Read more\n",
      "\n",
      "In air pollution terms China is two countries, divided by a line that follows the Huai river. North of this line average winter temperatures are below freezing and here free or heavily subsidised coal was provided for home heating. This led to the development of poorly controlled, coal-powered, district heating systems in towns and cities north of the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "The laudable aim of providing home heating was disastrous for China’s air. Average particle pollution north of the Huai river was 40% greater than the south and this extra pollution caused an estimated three-year reduction in average life expectancy.\n",

      "\n",
      "Global retail giant Walmart has paid $16bn (£11.8bn) for a majority stake in Flipkart, India's biggest online retailer, making this the world's largest ever e-commerce acquisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walmart, best known for its grocery stores, discount department stores and hypermarkets, is ubiquitous in the US. But its sales have barely grown offline and its online sales account for just a little more than 3% of its business in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flipkart, founded in 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal (no relation), is India's biggest e-commerce company and has had high-profile investors including Microsoft, Tencent and Softbank.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after Walmart announced the deal on Wednesday, its shares tumbled 4%, a likely reflection of the high price the company paid for Flipkart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did Walmart spend so much on Flipkart?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"India is one of the most attractive retail markets in the world, given its size and growth rate,\" Walmart's president and CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walmart is betting on the fact that India's e-commerce market, pegged at a modest $38bn in 2017, is expected to grow up to $200bn by 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "E-commerce currently makes up less than 4% of the retail market in India, but that's predicted to change as the number of Indians using smartphones (and the internet) increases rapidly in the next decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Walmart is ubiquitous in the US\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Walmart has 21 \"cash-and-carry\" wholesale stores in India that sell to businesses, it has no other retail presence in the country. So this acquisition allows the company to jump straight into a small but growing e-commerce market with about 100 million customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This deal is also a new front in Walmart's battle with Amazon, the global leader in online retail, which accounts for 44% of the US e-commerce market.\n",
      "\n",
      "How big is Flipkart?\n",
      "\n",
      "The company sold products worth a total of $7.5bn in the financial year that ended in March 2018 - the sales had grown by 50% since the previous year. Its net sales, after discounts, returns and cancellation, were worth $4.6bn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon, too, made a bid for Flipkart but the merger could have faced severe scrutiny from India's antitrust regulator as their combined sales would have added up to almost 90% of India's e-commerce market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did Walmart's stock crash after the deal was announced?\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysts believed that Walmart overpaid for its stake in Flipkart. This widely-held view was echoed on Wall Street, where Walmart shares dropped to their lowest intraday price since October 2017, wiping $10bn off its market capitalisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Flipkart claims more than 100 million registered users in India\n",
      "\n",
      "This is because Flipkart is not expected to be profitable for some years and the Indian e-commerce market is small by global standards - 100 million customers in a country with about 1.3 billion people.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the deal still gives Walmart the fastest entry possible into one of the most promising, albeit difficult, e-commerce markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walmart said in a media release that Flipkart will leverage Walmart's diverse retail expertise, merchandise supply-chain knowledge and financial strength, while Flipkart's \"talent, technology, customer insights and agile and innovative culture\" will benefit Walmart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this a good deal for Flipkart?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, according to most experts. After Walmart bought the controlling stake, Flipkart is valued at more than $20bn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deal also saves Flipkart, which was running out of cash in its battle with Amazon. Both competitors have been \"burning cash\" in massive sales and discounts pegged to Indian festivals in a bid to acquire more customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sachin Bansal is one of the founders of Flipkart\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon runs a profitable business worldwide, thanks to its cloud computing service, and it has the cash to take on newer markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flipkart, however, needs the financial strength Walmart offers. It has also managed an excellent valuation, by all accounts, giving both its co-founder Sachin Bansal, and several of its key investors, profitable exits.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the highest price any foreign company has paid for a stake in an Indian company. New York-based angel investor Gautam Gandhi said Flipkart's founders had been elevated from \"role models to demi-gods for aspiring entrepreneurs\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Was this a good deal for Flipkart's other investors?\n",
      "\n",
      "Given Flipkart's high valuation of $20bn, investors who exited got a good deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Venture capital firms Accel and Tiger Global invested more than eight years ago when Flipkart was valued at just $50m - and they have now exited with more than 400 times what they invested.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SoftBank Vision Fund led by Masayoshi Son was a big beneficiary of the deal - it had invested $2.5bn in August 2017 for a 20% stake and it exited with $4bn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal retains his stake. So do Microsoft, eBay and China's Tencent, who invested a total of $1.4bn in April 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does Walmart bring to the table?\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from capital, Walmart brings expertise in online groceries and a strong food supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We aim to become the best food retailer in the world, and that needs investment in supply chains to build those capabilities,\" Rajneesh Kumar, corporate affairs chief at Walmart India told the BBC.\n",

      "\n",
      "What does the rest of India's e-commerce market look like?\n",
      "\n",

      "Microsoft has updated Notepad, its legendary text editor, with something that’s been on the wishlist of most Windows-using coders — the ability to view and edit text files created on UNIX-based systems, like macOS and Linux.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds strange, but for its 20 years of existence, Notepad only supported Windows End of Line (EOL) characters. These are Carriage Return (CR) & Line Feed (LF).\n",
      "\n",
      "This meant that if you opened a text file created on a Unix system, it’d look… well… a little screwy. Below is a .bashrc file opened in Notepad. Notice how it’s all squished together. Yikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thankfully, that’s no longer the case — at least for anyone running the latest Insider build of Windows 10. Although Notepad defaults to Windows EOL characters by default, it can now read, edit and print Unix/Linux and Macintosh line endings.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can read about it here on Microsoft’s blog. This is great news, especially given that Windows 10 is increasingly favored by developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where once you’d go to a developer conference and be confronted by a sea of MacBook Pros, you now often encounter islands of Surface Books and Dell XPS laptops. That’s because Microsoft has done a lot of work in courting the developer demographic, with efforts like the Linux Subsystem for Windows, and porting BASH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, hardly anyone does any serious development in Notepad. It lacks the most basic features, like syntax highlighting, plugins, and more. That said, given that it’s often used for quick-and-dirty edit jobs, it’s nice that Microsoft fixed this common bugbear with one of its oldest existing products.\n",

      "Major depression is on the rise among Americans from all age groups, but is rising fastest among teens and young adults, new health insurance data shows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression rates also vary a lot state by state, with Rhode Island having the highest rate of depression at 6.4 percent. Hawaii has the lowest rate — 2.1 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The findings cover people with commercial health insurance — Blue Cross and Blue Shield — so they’re not fully representative. But most people in the U.S. are covered by a commercial health plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rates of major depression diagnosis by state. Courtesy Blue Cross Blue Shield\n",
      "\n",
      "The findings are almost certainly an underestimate, as well. The Blue Cross Blue Shield data comes from 41 million health records and counts people who got a diagnosis of major depression. Many people who report symptoms of depression say they have not been diagnosed or sought treatment for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s behind the increase?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Many people are worried about how busy they are,” said Dr. Laurel Williams, chief of psychiatry at Texas Children’s Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a lack of community. There’s the amount of time that we spend in front of screens and not in front of other people. If you don’t have a community to reach out to, then your hopelessness doesn’t have any place to go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Kids and young adults, especially, feel rushed and pressured, Williams said.\n",
      "\n",
      "While social media can connect people who might otherwise feel isolated, it can also help pile on the pressure, she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wouldn’t say that social media is responsible for a rise in depression — more the being rushed and lack of connections that we have in the structure of how we live lives now,” she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dr. Karyn Horowitz of Bradley Hospital in Rhode Island thinks social media may be a big factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For some kids, video game use can become an addiction leading to social isolation, poor school performance, and impaired sleep,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is possible that the increased rates of depression in adolescents is related to a combination of increased electronics use and sleep disruptions in already vulnerable individuals,” she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the report, Blue Cross and Blue Shield looked at medical health insurance claims from 41 million insurance holders.\n",

      "Diagnosis rate and rate of change for major depression by age. Courtesy Blue Cross Blue Shield\n",

      "\"Diagnoses of major depression have risen dramatically by 33 percent since 2013,\" the report reads.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the report, 2.6 percent of youths aged 12 to17 were diagnosed with major depression in 2016, a 63 percent increase from 1.6 percent in 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among young adults aged 18 to 34, 4.4 percent had major depression in 2016, compared to 3 percent in 2013. That’s a 47 percent increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The highest percentage of major depression diagnoses were among people aged 35 to 49. The survey found 5.8 percent of 35-to 49-year-olds had major depression in 2016, compared to 4.6 percent three years before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most people had some other condition along with depression and 29 percent had four or more additional health problems such as diabetes or heart disease, the report found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medical problems can lead to depression, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression “may be caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors,” the CDC says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk factors include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Experiencing traumatic or stressful events, such as physical or sexual abuse, the death of a loved one, or financial problems\n",
      "\n",
      "Going through a major life change‚ even if it was planned\n",

      "Using alcohol or drugs\n",
      "\n",
      "Having blood relatives who have had depression\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps most troubling is the high rate of children and young adults who have depression, the report said. Many years of risk lie ahead if they do not get treatment, which can include medication, therapy or both.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CDC says one in five children ages 3 through 17 — about 15 million — have a diagnosable mental, emotional or behavioral disorder in a given year. But only 20 percent of them get diagnosed or receive care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children with depression often seem irritable rather than sad or anxious, the National Institute of Mental Health says. That can make symptoms easy to miss, as can their busy lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A lot of parents will say to me, ‘Well, she seemed fine to me and she was going to school,’” Williams said.\n",

Their first special program on go, “Twitch Plays Go,” will be broadcast live on the main channel - twitch.tv/twitch - starting at 11am PST, April 28. Twitch’s introduction to go for the greater gaming community will feature a tutorial on the rules of the game, a special showing of The Surrounding Game documentary with Q&A, the first-ever massively-multiplayer online go game, and live commentary on the 2018 Creator’s Invitational tournament and College Go League Championship with organizer Stephen Hu and pro player/Go streamer Hajin Lee.\n",

      "Every morning I wake up to the same routine. I log into the Tinder account of a 45-year-old man from Texas—a client. I flirt with every woman in his queue for 10 minutes, sending their photos and locations to a central database of potential “Opportunities.” For every phone number I get, I make $1.75.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m what’s called a “Closer” for the online-dating service ViDA (Virtual Dating Assistants). Men and women (though mostly men) from all over the world pay this company to outsource the labor and tedium of online dating. The matches I speak to on behalf of the Texan man and other clients have no idea they’re chatting with a professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "It shouldn’t come as a surprise that these ghostwriting services exist. Tinder alone produces more than 12 million matches a day, and if you’re a heterosexual American, you now have a one in three chance of meeting your future husband or wife online. But as e-romance hits an all-time high, our daily dose of rejection, harassment, and heartbreak creeps upward, too. Once you mix in the vague rules of netiquette and a healthy fear of catfishing scams, it’s easy to see why someone might want to outsource their online-dating profile to a pro, if only to keep themselves sane.\n",
      "\n",
      "But where does the digital social assistant end and the con artist begin?\n",
      "\n",
      "The online seduction manual\n",
      "\n",
      "When I tell people that I work as an online-dating assistant, their initial reaction is of morbid curiosity. “How did you even find out about that?” they ask, voices lowering, leaning in.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November 2017, I ran across an ad seeking “people with good Tinder skills” for a job as a “Virtual Dating Assistant.” At first I thought it was a joke, but I completed their online form out of pure fascination. I received a callback three days later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could I work in an “moral gray area?” Would I be comfortable ranking clients’ photographs? Was I dating anyone currently?\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently, professional writers make for good online-dating assistants; knowing how to seduce strangers with the written word is the company’s mandate, after all. But the intake interviewer seemed just as interested in my ethical flexibility as he was in the journalistic details of my résumé. Could I work in an “moral gray area?” Would I be comfortable ranking clients’ photographs? Was I dating anyone currently?\n",
      "\n",
      "I learned that there are two main types of writers at the company: “Profile Writers,” who create seductive and click-worthy profiles based on facts our clients have supplied about themselves, and “Closers,” who log in to clients’ dating accounts at least twice a day to respond to messages from matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite hiring writers to do this work, virtually none of what the company does requires creativity of any kind. Profile Writers follow strict guidelines, often recycling the same half-dozen clichés over and over again. If a client has a dog (jackpot!), all the Profile Writer needs to do is search for the word “dog” in their manual and choose from a list of dog-related one-liners, like this one:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey. As an animal lover, I want to find out your opinion… dressing up your dog: yes or no?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The process for Closers is a bit more complicated. The initial training period lasts several weeks before we’re given access to clients’ accounts, during which we must read several training manuals and submit draft responses to fake matches. At first, my trainer encouraged me to get creative with my replies, but by the third week, I was still getting back extensive rewrites. My most frequent mistake was asking career-oriented questions, which were deemed too difficult for some women to answer. “She seems more simple,” my trainer would write in response. “Let’s try a different approach.” My meaningful questions would disappear from our shared GoogleDoc, replaced by simpler, condescending small talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "My Closer manuals were written by the company’s founder, Scott Valdez, a self-taught dating expert with a background in sales. The manuals have titles like Women On Demand and The Automatic Date Transition, and are loaded with his personal insights into the primal female brain. We are to treat them as dating-assistant gospel.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no question about it,” reads one chapter, “women want to date the alpha male. They are naturally drawn to the ‘leader of the pack.’” Valdez elaborates later in the manual: “The alpha male is the selector, he chooses… he is not chosen.” But how do you present yourself as an Alpha? “Never compliment her without a qualification,” he writes. “Let her know what you want in a woman and make her explain why she fits those criteria.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not a psychologist or self-proclaimed expert in the multiple facets of human psychology,” Valdez told Quartz in a phone call. “I consider myself to be a marketer, a matchmaker, and a dating expert.” He lists the books he’s read that inform his methods: Malcolm Gladwell’s Blink, Dan Ariely’s Predictably Irrational, David J. Lieberman’s Get Anyone To Do Anything, (“which kind of scared my mom”), and the classic Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Online dating takes effort, and effort equals time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Online dating takes effort, and effort equals time,” he continued. “With [dating apps’] explosion in popularity, it means that you have a huge dating pool at your fingertips, but you’re also in direct competition with everyone else in your area. So if you want to have a chance at meeting your most intriguing matches, you need to have the best possible profile, photos, and messages.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In my guise as a middle-aged American male, it’s my job to pursue women on our clients’ behalf. These people are often in their early 20s; young women with less dating savvy are easy targets for the company’s methods. “Rule 1: Don’t make her think too hard,” the manual says. “When writing sales copy…the goal is to reduce her ‘cognitive load’ so she’s more likely to reach the end and still have energy to write out a reply.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What does a “low cognitive load” pick-up line look like? My personal favorite:\n",
      "\n",
      "A beautiful seaplane. A suitcase full of cash. And a dashing co-pilot. Whereto?\n",

      "These pick-up lines are mostly sent by a third type of employee, “Matchmakers,” who send out opening messages en masse across every dating platform imaginable: Tinder, Bumble, match.com, POF, Luxy, and Seeking Arrangement, to name just a few. As part of the company’s all-inclusive service, Matchmakers will scour these platforms for potential matches and then send copy-and pasted opening messages to those who fulfill their clients’ preferences, such as “must love cats” or “should know how to cook.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But combing through each woman’s profile would require too much time, so Matchmakers are instead taught to generalize a client’s preferences as much as possible and then select an opening line that could work for hundreds of women. For example, does Client X like to travel? That’s easy: Client X’s Matchmaker can search the company manual for the word “travel” and select from a handful of vague travel-related greetings. From there, after the client has approved the message, a one-liner blitz will rain down on dozens of dating sites, targeting hundreds of women with the word “travel” in their profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have a lot of ice-breaker messages that are billed around specific interests, like yoga or skiing or having a very short profile,” Valdez told Quartz. ”If there’s a message that the client doesn’t like, we take it out of rotation.” After the Matchmakers have made contact, the Closers then step in to keep up the flirty banter and, hopefully, get their client a date. Clients are sent weekly emails to alert them of numbers we’ve scored or, for Platinum clients, when and where to go for a date we’ve arranged.\n",
      "\n",
      "This messaging “blast” technique may appear lucrative compared to the average neighborhood yenta, but it has occurred to me that good matchmaking may not be in the company’s financial interest. When a client pairs up, they leave the service. And with ViDA charging each client anywhere from $495 to $1,695 a month for its services, there is a significant financial incentive to keep them coming back.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, tell me about yourself\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally a sales guy with no time for “real dates,” Valdez grew ViDA’s brand out of his own experiences in the dating world. Before Tinder normalized “DTF” (“Down To Fuck”) as an opening salute, Valdez would send copy-and-pasted pick-up lines to dozens of women a day and track their effectiveness on spreadsheets. “Online dating is a numbers game,” he would write in the ViDA training manual years later.\n",
      "\n",
      "His idea for a digital-dating-assistant service started in 2009, when he was frustrated with the amount of time it took to search for matches online. “I was working 60 to 70 hours a week and simply didn’t have time to keep up with online dating,” he said. “Before my life had gotten so crazy, I’d managed to develop some material that worked really well on the dating sites I was using. But I was at the point where I was only able to return messages sporadically, which obviously didn’t go too well with the matches I was interested in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought, ‘Why couldn’t I just take what I had developed, and train someone else to sound like me, and outsource my online dating to him?’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I found myself wishing there were two of me,” he continued. “I thought, ‘Why couldn’t I just take what I had developed, and train someone else to sound like me, and outsource my online dating to him?’” After finding someone on Craigslist who “did a really great job,” Valdez started thinking about how many people were in the same position: time-poor professionals who might benefit from some of the lessons he’d learnt. “If it weren’t for my relentless dedication to cracking the code to meeting and attracting the right person, I probably wouldn’t have met the girl I’m with now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Today the company employs 80 people and boasts 2,500 “satisfied customers.” But the same cannot be said for all of its employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked my coworkers how they handle the moral flexibility that the work demands. One male Closer told me that it felt rewarding to “help men too old to understand the internet,” and that “some people are too busy for all that.” Another writer told me that “finding love is a mysterious process, so we use data.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The service’s data-driven approach to professional flirting became clear to me during my training. “We’ve discovered that a surprisingly large portion of the online dating process can be systematized into what is essentially clerical work,” read one line in my training manual. “Really, when you think about it, you’re writing sales copy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To this end, every message I send is logged into an automated system that analyzes response rates. Closers regularly discuss what works and what doesn’t, swapping tips in extensive email chains. There are required monthly team meetings, in which Closers help workshop opening messages and pitch new ideas. While the list of company-approved opening lines is constantly evolving, the formula is almost always the same: a vague reference to something on the match’s profile, followed by an extremely easy question, like “I see you’re into yoga…. so answer this question once and for all: which is better, hot or not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Paradoxically, ViDA’s manual says that honesty is key to seduction. One chapter titled Don’t Lie includes lines like, “There are few things women hate more than insincerity” and “If you’ve told your date you’re a six-foot-tall astronaut when actually you’re 5 ft 9 and sell insurance, she’s going to find out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s about trust and making sure we represent them in a way that’s comfortable for them and feels authentic, because at the end of the day they’re going to be the one going on the date,” he added over the phone. “It’s important that everything that we do feels right and feels true to who they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m not an astronaut or an insurance salesman. I’m a woman sitting in my living room in Montréal, running proxies on my smartphone and laptop. I’m logged into my client’s Tinder and match.com accounts, appearing on these platforms (with the help of numerous fake GPS services) to be the man I’m pretending to be. I sit on my couch and wait for messages to arrive in their inbox.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you like Pink Floyd?” I write to one match. “Cool. I saw them in concert in ‘77.” This technically isn’t a fib: My client did see Pink Floyd in 1977—though I wasn’t born until 1992.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was three weeks into my contract when I encountered a client whose age was listed as 25. Written beside his photos was a casual disclaimer: “…he’s actually 33 but wants to present like 25 to attract younger ladies.” Shaving two or three years off of a client’s age was common practice, but eight years felt predatory. I sent an email inquiring about the company’s policies, and never heard back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If a client requests it, we may add an inch or two onto the displayed height or shave a year or two off the listed age, but we don’t like to do anything that’s really big,” Valdez explained to Quartz. “The goal is for the client to meet their matches face to face and hopefully spark a long-term relationship. So big lies about important facts undermine that goal. We make sure our clients understand that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If a woman doesn’t respond to our cheesy pick-up lines or cough up her number by the third message, I’m instructed to move on, as the match is no longer cost-effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite my attempts at embracing the “Alpha Male” attitude, the training staff have repeatedly told me that my writing is “too female,” a characteristic that has never been fully explained. To mitigate this “error,” I’ve been told I need to use shorter sentences, ask fewer questions, use fewer smileys, wait longer to reply, and set up dates before even asking if the woman is interested. If a woman doesn’t respond to our cheesy pick-up lines or cough up her number by the third message, I’m instructed to move on, as the match is no longer cost-effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Closers aren’t paid for the time they spend waiting for new messages, so I reread my clients’ intake questionnaires in order to bill my base salary of $12 an hour. Every client must answer 50 or so questions about themselves when they first sign up and go through a 90-minute interview, supplying Profile Writers and Closers with nuggets of mundane information. Most of it is useless when it comes to fuel for flirtatious banter—like “I took piano lessons until I was 5 years old,” or “I had fun at my sister’s wedding”—but these lifeless anecdotes are all we have to draw from.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several times a day, female staffers receive Photo Ranking Requests, in which we rank new clients’ photos in order of attractiveness. This helps Matchmakers select which photos to use when building or updating a client’s dating profile. “We don’t like to declare that this client’s a 9, this client’s a 6, or compare our clients in any way,” Valdez said. “We do, however, rank the attractiveness of a single client’s photos against one another. We just employ a data-driven ranking process for choosing the most attractive pictures…We do this internally to determine a client’s optimal photo lineup.” He mentioned that OkCupid used to run a similar service, and Tinder can also optimize your photographs so that the most popular are shown first.\n",
      "\n",
      "One Profile Writer I spoke with (I’ll call him Doug) was candid about his dilemmas over the company’s practices. After working as a Closer for two years, Doug had asked to switch to Profile Writing. He’d taken to referring to Closer work as “the dark side.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Doug told me that a lot of clients never call the women “who have been really engaged emotionally and are responding to our messages.” Once Closers receive their commission for getting a number ($1.75 each), they move on. But if a woman never hears from the client—the man she believes she’s been corresponding with the whole time—she might send more messages through the app, upset that she hasn’t heard from him. But the Closer is no longer allowed to reply, so he ghosts her. There’s no more money to be made.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am creating these bitter women out there,” he said. “I ask myself if I’m part of the problem.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Doug learned to unmatch from women once he’d received his commission. It was easier for him that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fool’s gold\n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of person would pay strangers to score them dates online, and then not even bother to call? Clients who can afford to ignore phone numbers because they receive so many a week are internally referred to as “Cash Cows.” They go on several dates a week for months or sometimes years on end, traveling frequently to new areas and an ever-expanding pool of women. These clients tend to be younger men in high-powered finance jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valdez said that the typical client profile tends to be somebody between the ages of about 28 and 52, with most being in their 30s. (He also claims that one third of their clients are female.) From there, it divides into two camps: those who “have more money than time,” and those who are just plain frustrated. “Entrepreneurs, doctors, lawyers,” he lists. “Programmers, too—especially programmers in the Bay Area. We get a lot of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“[ViDA allows] them to delegate this particular aspect of their lives to an expert, just as many have financial planners, landscapers, personal trainers, and mechanics on speed dial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These types of professionals are money rich but time poor, he explains. Valdez referenced a recent survey that shows online love seekers are spending 10 hours a week on dating sites and apps. “Our clients have successful careers,” he said. “They work, they travel often, and they just don’t have that time. So the need a company like ViDA fills is allowing them to delegate this particular aspect of their lives to an expert, just as many have financial planners, landscapers, personal trainers, and mechanics on speed dial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, there are plenty of older men seeking age-appropriate, long-term relationships online. These are the types of clients Doug and Valdez always refer to when justifying the service, as our work helps them navigate unfamiliar territory. After all, internet culture does not come naturally to some, and many of our clients are widowed or divorced retirees.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked one of my trainers if the company takes on any married clients. Men looking to quietly set up extramarital affairs would benefit from the company’s all-hands approach; they wouldn’t even need to install the dating apps or visit the websites we use. Matchmakers will select their best photos, Profile Writers will make them sound appealing, and Closers will do all the flirting for them. Our clients need only check whatever email they’ve provided for date locations and phone numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "My trainer was quick to reassure me that they refuse those prospective clients. “Even if the guy’s lying about it, Scott has a whole system for how we deal with that situation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked about this policy directly, Valdez pointed out that their website clearly states that they do not take on married clients or those looking to cheat; he also said that the extensive on-boarding process tends to weed out any immoral actors. “I couldn’t sleep well at night knowing we are helping people wreck their families. We’ve never knowingly helped cheaters,” he says. “There are a lot of other ways I’d prefer to make money than helping people mess up their family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it even legal?\n",
      "\n",
      "The company’s practices may be unethical—but they’re not illegal. Once the company obtains the client’s permission to impersonate them online, there are no laws against what Closers do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, it’s left to individual platforms to crack down on fake accounts. OKCupid, for instance, makes it clear in their terms of service that third parties are not allowed to open accounts, and it’s not uncommon for clients’ profiles to get flagged and deleted. But from a legal perspective, unless a Closer harasses or threatens a match, exposes a client’s confidential information, or asks for money, everything they do is legal according to US, Canadian, and UK law.\n",
      "\n",
      "But legality aside, these cut-and-paste flirtations perpetuate negative gender stereotypes, and they reinforce an oversimplified (and destructive) view of romantic expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Men and women on online-dating platforms therefore learn to emulate personalities that yield quantifiable results.\n",
      "\n",
      "As dating platforms become flooded with calculated, flirtatious spam, men and women on these sites learn to emulate personalities that yield quantifiable results. This means playing down unique traits and unorthodox views to the point where a total stranger—like me—could literally do it in their place. By trying to appeal to dozens, if not hundreds, of strangers at the same time, we forfeit our ability to take risks and experiment with social norms; only placing safe bets robs us of new and genuine experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the steepest price of this online anonymity appears to be human decency, which—as I’m often reminded at ViDA—doesn’t lead to dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, one match told me that she’d just put down her family dog. Still in training, I wasn’t sure what to do. I wrote out an apology for her loss and sent it to my instructor for approval. He crossed out my response and wrote underneath: “Alpha Males don’t apologize.” What we sent back instead was an upbeat story about our client’s two dogs, which was a shamefully inconsiderate reply in my view. I expected to never hear back from her, but three exchanges later, she was sending me her phone number.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was my first commission: $1.75.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had she blamed my client’s callous response on internet miscommunication? Or was she learning—just as I was—that reaching out for a unique connection online would lead only to awkwardness and rejection? Every time she has an interaction in which her feelings are ignored—whether it’s online or in-person—I worry that she’ll learn not to talk about her emotional needs, or any needs of any kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the disillusioned masses learn to offer less and expect nothing, companies like these can take advantage of this extraordinarily low barrier to entry. That cringe-worthy “dashing co-pilot” opening line might sound impossibly lame—but it works. (And at least it’s not the bare minimum “DTF?” or an unsolicited dick pic.) As a result, businesses such as these are an economic inevitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "* * *\n",
      "\n",
      "I was given my first female client after two months with the company. Women seeking out our services require a very different approach. When talking to my new client’s matches, I was told to make her voice sound “feminine (soft, warm, delicious, flowing, focusing on how she feels about things).” I had to “focus less on her career and more on her outside life…write longer sentences, more emoticons, and be more playful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Doug’s view, it’s our job to act as gatekeepers for these female clients—to make sure no subpar matches make it through. “Women are so put into a box, and they aren’t going to represent what they really want,” he said. According to him, a Closer should ask the tough questions that female clients aren’t comfortable asking themselves: Does the match want children? Are they looking for something serious? Are they dating anyone else right now?\n",
      "\n",
      "I took his advice to heart and played hardball with my female client’s matches. None of the men fit her description of what she wanted, so by the end of the first week, I had not pursued any phone numbers. I was reprimanded for not producing results, and for wasting both the company and the client’s time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our clients are interested in finding their ideal match, and if the writers aren’t getting them closer to that goal, then we’re not fulfilling our commitment to our customer,” Valdez said. “So we might realize that a writer’s writing style isn’t a fit for a client or the match that client wants to attract, so we simply shift them to a client that he or she is better equipped to help.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Closer was given my account. Overnight, they scored seven numbers from the matches I’d already vetoed—an additional $12.25 in their pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to make my exit soon after.\n",
      "\n",
      "My initial curiosity about these dating assistants had morphed steadily into deep disgust: with the company, with Valdez and his manual, and—above all—myself. The sight of my first paycheck sent me crawling back to bed in a guilt-ridden panic.\n",
      "\n",
      "I grew suspicious of my own dating accounts—not just of the men I matched with, but of my own ability to present a likable version of myself online. Every new conversation felt like a minefield, filling me with equal parts boredom and dread. To my dismay, I started to want my own virtual dating assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "This all begs the question: Have you unknowingly flirted with a professional Closer? Me, even?\n",
      "\n",
      "As we grow accustomed to foisting more and more complicated emotional tasks onto digital butlers, we lose our ability to tolerate inelegance or find value in social failure. Moments of awkwardness and heartbreak are an inevitable part of the dating experience, and they are essential in our evolution into mature adults. By outsourcing our courtship to robots (and robot-like humans) we might save ourselves some pain in the short term, but it degrades us, simplifies us, and fails to provide for our ultimate goal of finding someone accepting of our flaws. In this age of automation, romance isn’t just one click away—it’s guaranteed.\n",

      "Credit Karma is best known for being the only reason anyone is ever willing to peek at their credit score, but the company has other things it wants you to be less stressed out about too.\n",
      "\n",
      "After introducing a free identity monitoring tool for its users late last year, Credit Karma is widening the scope of its fraud-fighting scans to include data from the dark web.\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit Karma’s existing ID-monitoring tool searches 4.5 billion public breaches for a user’s personal data, but the improved service will scour additional breaches culled from the dark web. Added up, the tool will now search through 13 billion data breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "By checking its own database of 80 million Credit Karma users against the information in both pools of data, the company can give users a heads up when their info is compromised.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The problem is pervasive and the data set that we have is relatively comprehensive,” Anish Acharya, Credit Karma’s vice president of data products, told TechCrunch. Credit Karma partnered with security firm SpyCloud for its databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the company mixes in the new dark web data, affected Credit Karma users that pop up in its scans will receive an alert so they can find more contextual information through the free tool and lock down their accounts accordingly. Credit Karma users can even specifically view which of their passwords are no longer safe to use so that they know which passwords to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company estimates that 65 percent of its users have experienced a data breach, whether they know it or not, so Credit Karma is well-positioned to issue a wake-up call about protecting identifying information online.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Acharya, the ID-monitoring tool grew out of the same beliefs that inspired Credit Karma’s namesake product.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It follows that same sort of philosophical point,” Acharya said. “This is really a set of information that consumers need to be empowered with.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Much like its relatively stress-free credit score checks, Credit Karma wants to make its users less freaked out by the idea of identity theft — an unavoidable relative of leading an online existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The goal is actually decreasing fear and anxiety by empowering consumers,” Acharya said. “It’s a very scary conversation… it’s not a conversation you’re having with friends over a beer — [not] today at least.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Credit Karma’s dark web monitoring service is available now to consumers through the company’s app (check ID Monitoring in the Settings menu) and through the Resources tab on the Credit Karma website.\n",

      "Ford today announced it will phase out most cars it sells in North America. According to its latest financial release, the auto giant “will transition to two vehicles” — the Mustang and an unannounced vehicle, the Focus Active, being the only traditional cars it sells in the region. Ford sees 90 percent of its North America portfolio in trucks, utilities and commercial vehicles. Citing a reduction in consumer demand and product profitability, Ford is in turn not investing in the next generation of sedans. The Taurus is no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The press release also talks about a new type of vehicle, though it sounds like a crossover. This so-called white space vehicle will “combine the best attributes of cars and utilities, such as higher ride height, space and versatility.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, Ford sells six sedans and coupes in North America: the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion, C-Max, Mustang and Taurus. This lineup hits multiple segments, from the compact Fiesta to the mid-size Focus, C-Max and Fusion to the full-size Taurus. The Mustang stands alone as the lone coupe.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s likely Lincoln’s sedans will also disappear, though this was not explicitly stated in today’s press release. Lincoln currently sells the mid-size MKZ and full-size Continental — both share platforms with Ford counterparts. If Ford is phasing out development of sedan platforms, Lincoln will likely suffer, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "This reduction in traditional cars was a long time coming. North America consumers have increasingly turned to crossovers, trucks and SUVs over sedans and small cars. A trip to any parking lot will likely produce more evidence to this movement. There are several factors involved, from more fuel-efficient and better-equipped trucks and SUVs to improved safety ratings and ride qualities of these vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ford also today reaffirmed its commitment to bringing hybrid-electric powertrains to the F-150, Mustang, Explorer, Escape and upcoming Bronco.\n",
      "\n",
      "This announcement comes several weeks after Ford explained in broad terms its love affair of trucks and SUVs. Ford estimates that SUVs could make up as much as half the entire U.S. industry’s retail market by 2020, and that’s why it’s shifting $7 billion in investment capital from its cars business over to the SUV segment. By 2020, Ford also aims to have high-performance SUVs in market, including five with hybrid powertrains and one fully battery-electric model.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this big hybrid push on the SUV side, Ford expects to go from second to first-place in the U.S. hybrid vehicles market by sales, surpassing current leader Toyota by 2021, thanks also to the forthcoming hybrid Mustang and F-150.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sedan was long a staple for Ford. The Lincoln Continental defined the ’60s. And then there was the Ford Galaxy, which was available in countless variations for nearly 20 years. Then in the ’80s came the LTD, Crown Victoria and Taurus. Ford even went rally racing with its cars, namely the Escort and later Focus. But while all these nameplates rose and fell, there was another always present: The Mustang.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ford’s little pony turned 54 in April 2018. The Mustang has been in production since 1964 and seems ready for yet another generation of drivers. The car has been reinvented several times and will likely be reinvented several more before its nameplate is retired. For now, though, the Mustang is here to stay.\n",

      "Researchers discovered a flaw in Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant that enabled them to eavesdrop on consumers with smart devices – and automatically transcribe every word said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A malicious proof-of-concept Amazon Echo Skill shows how attackers can abuse the Alexa virtual assistant to eavesdrop on consumers with smart devices – and automatically transcribe every word said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Checkmarx researchers told Threatpost that they created a proof-of-concept Alexa Skill that abuses the virtual assistant’s built-in request capabilities. The rogue Skill begins with the initiation of an Alexa voice-command session that fails to terminate (stop listening) after the command is given. Next, any recorded audio is transcribed (if voices are captured) and a text transcript is sent to a hacker. Checkmarx said it brought its proof-of-concept attack to Amazon’s attention and that the company fixed a coding flaw that allowed the rogue Skill to capture prolonged audio on April 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On default, Alexa ends the sessions after each duration… we were able to build in a feature that kept the session going [so Alexa would continue listening]. We also wanted to make sure that the user is not prompted and that Alexa is still listening without re-prompts,” Erez Yalon, manager of Application Security Research at Checkmarx, told Threatpost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Checkmarx researchers said they were able to manipulate code within a built-in Alexa JavaScript library (ShouldEndSession) to pull off the hack. The JavaScript library is tied to Alexa’s orders to stop listening if it doesn’t hear the user’s command properly. Checkmarx’s tweak to the code simply enabled Alexa to continue listening, no matter the voice request order.\n",
      "\n",
      "One challenge for researchers was the issue of the “reprompt” feature in Alexa. Reprompts are used by Alexa if the service keeps the session open after sending the response but the user does not say anything, so Alexa will ask the user to repeat the order. However, Checkmarx researchers were able to replace the reprompt feature with empty reprompts, so that a listening cycle starts without letting the user know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, researchers accurately transcribed the voice received by skills: “In order to be able to listen and transcribe any arbitrary text, we had to do two tricks. First, we added a new slot-type, which captures any singleword, not limited to a closed list of words. Second, in order to capture sentences at almost any length, we had to build a formatted string for each possible length,” according to the report.\n",
      "\n",
      "One big issue Checkmarx faced is that on Echo devices a shining blue ring reveals when Alexa listens. But, “the whole point of Alexa is that unlike a smartphone or tablet, you do not have to look at it to operate it,” said Yalon. “They are made to be placed in a corner where users simply speak to it without actively looking to its direction. And with Alexa voice services, vendor are embedding Alexa capabilities into their products and those products might not provide visual indication when the session is running.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon resolved this issue through tweaking several features on April 10, said Checkmarx. Researchers said Amazon fixed the problem by applying specific criteria to identify and reject eavesdropping skills during certification, detecting empty re-prompts and detecting longer-than-usual sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Checkmarx researcher Yalon, every “skill” needs to go through a certification process and be approved by Amazon before it can be published to the Amazon store.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Checkmarx did not try to publicly release the malicious skill… If we did, Amazon would need to approve it. We do not know the timeline of Amazon’s certification process, but we have no reason to believe (including after discussions with Amazon) that our malicious skill would not have been approved prior to the recent mitigations,” said Yalon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Customer trust is important to us and we take security and privacy seriously. We have put mitigations in place for detecting this type of skill behavior and reject or suppress those skills when we do,” an Amazon spokesperson told Threatpost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proof of concept raises questions about the privacy risks around voice services such as Alexa, as well as other connected devices in the home.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September, researchers devised a proof of concept that gives potentially harmful instructions to popular voice assistants like Siri, Google, Cortana, and Alexa using ultrasonic frequencies instead of voice commands. And in November, security firm Armis disclosed that Amazon Echo and Google Home devices are vulnerable to attacks through the over-the-air BlueBorne Bluetooth vulnerability.\n",

      "China asserts firm grip on research data\n",
      "\n",
      "SHANGHAI, CHINA—In a move few scientists anticipated, the Chinese government has decreed that all scientific data generated in China must be submitted to government-sanctioned data centers before appearing in publications. At the same time, the regulations, posted last week, call for open access and data sharing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The possibly conflicting directives puzzle researchers, who note that the yet-to-be-established data centers will have latitude in interpreting the rules. Scientists in China can still share results with overseas collaborators, says Xie Xuemei, who specializes in innovation economics at Shanghai University. Xie also believes that the new requirements to register data with authorities before submitting papers to journals will not affect most research areas. Gaining approval could mean publishing delays, Xie says, but “it will not have a serious impact on scientific research.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The new rules, issued by the powerful State Council, apply to all groups and individuals generating research data in China. The creation of a national data center will apparently fall to the science ministry, though other ministries and local governments are expected to create their own centers as well. Exempted from the call for open access and sharing are data involving state and business secrets, national security, “public interest,” and individual privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some researchers think the directives could be a good thing. “My understanding is that the impact on my own research will be positive,” says Li Di, chief scientist for radioastronomy at the National Astronomical Observatories of China in Beijing. “It explicitly emphasizes the role of a science data center to be ‘promoting open access to and sharing of science data.’” But the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) is concerned. “NSF bases its funding and its international collaboration on the principle of the freedom for scientists to publish all of the data they generate with U.S. funding, regardless of where the data are collected,” Nancy Sung, head of NSF’s Beijing office, wrote in an email to Science . “We would be concerned about any potential impact to this principle.”\n",

      "Henry David Thoreau (see name pronunciation; July 12, 1817 – May 6, 1862) was an American essayist, poet, philosopher, abolitionist, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, and historian. A leading transcendentalist,[2] Thoreau is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay \"Civil Disobedience\" (originally published as \"Resistance to Civil Government\"), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern-day environmentalism. His literary style interweaves close observation of nature, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, symbolic meanings, and historical lore, while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical austerity, and Yankee attention to practical detail.[3] He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover life's true essential needs.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that attacked the Fugitive Slave Law while praising the writings of Wendell Phillips and defending the abolitionist John Brown. Thoreau's philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr.[4]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoreau is sometimes referred to as an anarchist.[5][6] Though \"Civil Disobedience\" seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government—\"I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government\"[7]—the direction of this improvement contrarily points toward anarchism: \"'That government is best which governs not at all;' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.\"[7]\n",

      "Amos Bronson Alcott and Thoreau's aunt each wrote that \"Thoreau\" is pronounced like the word thorough ( THURR-oh—in General American,[8][9] but more precisely THOR-oh—in 19th-century New England). Edward Waldo Emerson wrote that the name should be pronounced \"Thó-row\", with the h sounded and stress on the first syllable.[10] Among modern-day American speakers, it is perhaps more commonly pronounced thə-ROH—with stress on the second syllable.[11][12]\n",

      "\n",
      "His face, once seen, could not be forgotten. The features were quite marked: the nose aquiline or very Roman, like one of the portraits of Caesar (more like a beak, as was said); large overhanging brows above the deepest set blue eyes that could be seen, in certain lights, and in others gray,—eyes expressive of all shades of feeling, but never weak or near-sighted; the forehead not unusually broad or high, full of concentrated energy and purpose; the mouth with prominent lips, pursed up with meaning and thought when silent, and giving out when open with the most varied and unusual instructive sayings.\n",

      "Henry David Thoreau was born David Henry Thoreau[15] in Concord, Massachusetts, into the \"modest New England family\"[16] of John Thoreau, a pencil maker, and Cynthia Dunbar. His paternal grandfather had been born on the UK crown dependency island of Jersey.[17] His maternal grandfather, Asa Dunbar, led Harvard's 1766 student \"Butter Rebellion\",[18] the first recorded student protest in the American colonies.[19] David Henry was named after his recently deceased paternal uncle, David Thoreau. He began to call himself Henry David after he finished college; he never petitioned to make a legal name change.[20] He had two older siblings, Helen and John Jr., and a younger sister, Sophia.[21] Thoreau's birthplace still exists on Virginia Road in Concord. The house has been restored by the Thoreau Farm Trust,[22] a nonprofit organization, and is now open to the public.\n",

      "He studied at Harvard College between 1833 and 1837. He lived in Hollis Hall and took courses in rhetoric, classics, philosophy, mathematics, and science.[citation needed] He was a member of the Institute of 1770[23] (now the Hasty Pudding Club). According to legend, Thoreau refused to pay the five-dollar fee (approximately equivalent to $123 in 2017) for a Harvard diploma. In fact, the master's degree he declined to purchase had no academic merit: Harvard College offered it to graduates \"who proved their physical worth by being alive three years after graduating, and their saving, earning, or inheriting quality or condition by having Five Dollars to give the college.\"[24] He commented, \"Let every sheep keep its own skin\",[25] a reference to the tradition of using sheepskin vellum for diplomas.\n",

      "The traditional professions open to college graduates—law, the church, business, medicine—did not interest Thoreau,[26]:25 so in 1835 he took a leave of absence from Harvard, during which he taught school in Canton, Massachusetts. After he graduated in 1837, he joined the faculty of the Concord public school, but he resigned after a few weeks rather than administer corporal punishment.[26]:25 He and his brother John then opened the Concord Academy, a grammar school in Concord, in 1838.[26]:25 They introduced several progressive concepts, including nature walks and visits to local shops and businesses. The school closed when John became fatally ill from tetanus in 1842 after cutting himself while shaving.[27][28] He died in Henry's arms.[29]\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon graduation Thoreau returned home to Concord, where he met Ralph Waldo Emerson through a mutual friend.[16] Emerson, who was 14 years his senior, took a paternal and at times patron-like interest in Thoreau, advising the young man and introducing him to a circle of local writers and thinkers, including Ellery Channing, Margaret Fuller, Bronson Alcott, and Nathaniel Hawthorne and his son Julian Hawthorne, who was a boy at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emerson urged Thoreau to contribute essays and poems to a quarterly periodical, The Dial, and lobbied the editor, Margaret Fuller, to publish those writings. Thoreau's first essay published in The Dial was \"Aulus Persius Flaccus,\"[30] an essay on the Roman playwright, in July 1840.[31] It consisted of revised passages from his journal, which he had begun keeping at Emerson's suggestion. The first journal entry, on October 22, 1837, reads, \"'What are you doing now?' he asked. 'Do you keep a journal?' So I make my first entry to-day.\"[32]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoreau was a philosopher of nature and its relation to the human condition. In his early years he followed Transcendentalism, a loose and eclectic idealist philosophy advocated by Emerson, Fuller, and Alcott. They held that an ideal spiritual state transcends, or goes beyond, the physical and empirical, and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine. In their view, Nature is the outward sign of inward spirit, expressing the \"radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts\", as Emerson wrote in Nature (1836).\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 18, 1841, Thoreau moved into the Emerson house.[33] There, from 1841 to 1844, he served as the children's tutor; he was also an editorial assistant, repairman and gardener. For a few months in 1843, he moved to the home of William Emerson on Staten Island,[34] and tutored the family's sons while seeking contacts among literary men and journalists in the city who might help publish his writings, including his future literary representative Horace Greeley.[35]:68\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoreau returned to Concord and worked in his family's pencil factory, which he would continue to do alongside his writing and other work for most of his adult life. He rediscovered the process of making good pencils with inferior graphite by using clay as the binder. This invention allowed profitable use of a graphite source found in New Hampshire that had been purchased in 1821 by Thoreau's brother-in-law, Charles Dunbar. The process of mixing graphite and clay, known as the Conté process, had been first patented by Nicolas-Jacques Conté in 1795. The company's other source of graphite had been Tantiusques, a mine operated by Native Americans in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. Later, Thoreau converted the pencil factory to produce plumbago, a name for graphite at the time, which was used in the electrotyping process.[36]\n",
      "\n",
      "Once back in Concord, Thoreau went through a restless period. In April 1844 he and his friend Edward Hoar accidentally set a fire that consumed 300 acres (1.2 km2) of Walden Woods.[37]\n",

      "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion. Henry David Thoreau, \"Where I Lived, and What I Lived For\", in Walden[38]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoreau felt a need to concentrate and work more on his writing. In March 1845, Ellery Channing told Thoreau, \"Go out upon that, build yourself a hut, & there begin the grand process of devouring yourself alive. I see no other alternative, no other hope for you.\"[39] Two months later, Thoreau embarked on a two-year experiment in simple living on July 4, 1845, when he moved to a small house he had built on land owned by Emerson in a second-growth forest around the shores of Walden Pond. The house was in \"a pretty pasture and woodlot\" of 14 acres (57,000 m2) that Emerson had bought,[40] 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from his family home.[41]\n",

      "On July 24 or July 25, 1846, Thoreau ran into the local tax collector, Sam Staples, who asked him to pay six years of delinquent poll taxes. Thoreau refused because of his opposition to the Mexican–American War and slavery, and he spent a night in jail because of this refusal. The next day Thoreau was freed when someone, likely to have been his aunt, paid the tax, against his wishes.[4] The experience had a strong impact on Thoreau. In January and February 1848, he delivered lectures on \"The Rights and Duties of the Individual in relation to Government\",[42] explaining his tax resistance at the Concord Lyceum. Bronson Alcott attended the lecture, writing in his journal on January 26:\n",
      "\n",
      "Heard Thoreau's lecture before the Lyceum on the relation of the individual to the State—an admirable statement of the rights of the individual to self-government, and an attentive audience. His allusions to the Mexican War, to Mr. Hoar's expulsion from Carolina, his own imprisonment in Concord Jail for refusal to pay his tax, Mr. Hoar's payment of mine when taken to prison for a similar refusal, were all pertinent, well considered, and reasoned. I took great pleasure in this deed of Thoreau's. Bronson Alcott, Journals[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoreau revised the lecture into an essay titled \"Resistance to Civil Government\" (also known as \"Civil Disobedience\"). It was published by Elizabeth Peabody in the Aesthetic Papers in May 1849. Thoreau had taken up a version of Percy Shelley's principle in the political poem \"The Mask of Anarchy\" (1819), which begins with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action.[44]\n",
      "\n",
      "At Walden Pond, Thoreau completed a first draft of A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, an elegy to his brother John, describing their trip to the White Mountains in 1839. Thoreau did not find a publisher for the book and instead printed 1,000 copies at his own expense; fewer than 300 were sold.[33]:234 He self-published the book on the advice of Emerson, using Emerson's publisher, Munroe, who did little to publicize the book.\n",

      "Thoreau left Walden Pond on September 6, 1847.[33]:244 At Emerson's request, he immediately moved back to the Emerson house to help Emerson's wife, Lidian, manage the household while her husband was on an extended trip to Europe.[45] Over several years, as he worked to pay off his debts, he continuously revised the manuscript of what he eventually published as Walden, or Life in the Woods in 1854, recounting the two years, two months, and two days he had spent at Walden Pond. The book compresses that time into a single calendar year, using the passage of the four seasons to symbolize human development. Part memoir and part spiritual quest, Walden at first won few admirers, but later critics have regarded it as a classic American work that explores natural simplicity, harmony, and beauty as models for just social and cultural conditions.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thoreau moved out of Emerson's house in July 1848 and stayed at a house on nearby Belknap Street. In 1850, he and his family moved into a house at 255 Main Street, where he lived until his death.[48]\n",

      "In the summer of 1850, Thoreau and Channing journeyed from Boston to Montreal and Quebec City. These would be Thoreau's only travels outside the United States.[49] It is as a result of this trip that he developed lectures that eventually became A Yankee in Canada. He jested that all he got from this adventure \"was a cold.\"[50] In fact, this proved an opportunity to contrast American civic spirit and democratic values with a colony apparently ruled by illegitimate religious and military power. Whereas his own country had had its revolution, in Canada history had failed to turn.[51]\n",

      "In 1851, Thoreau became increasingly fascinated with natural history and narratives of travel and expedition. He read avidly on botany and often wrote observations on this topic into his journal. He admired William Bartram and Charles Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle. He kept detailed observations on Concord's nature lore, recording everything from how the fruit ripened over time to the fluctuating depths of Walden Pond and the days certain birds migrated. The point of this task was to \"anticipate\" the seasons of nature, in his word.[52][53]\n",
      "\n",
      "He became a land surveyor and continued to write increasingly detailed observations on the natural history of the town, covering an area of 26 square miles (67 km2), in his journal, a two-million-word document he kept for 24 years. He also kept a series of notebooks, and these observations became the source of his late writings on natural history, such as \"Autumnal Tints\", \"The Succession of Trees\", and \"Wild Apples\", an essay lamenting the destruction of indigenous wild apple species.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until the 1970s, literary critics[who?] dismissed Thoreau's late pursuits as amateur science and philosophy. With the rise of environmental history and ecocriticism as academic disciplines, several new readings of Thoreau began to emerge, showing him to have been both a philosopher and an analyst of ecological patterns in fields and woodlots.[54][55] For instance, his late essay \"The Succession of Forest Trees\" shows that he used experimentation and analysis to explain how forests regenerate after fire or human destruction, through the dispersal of seeds by winds or animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "He traveled to Canada East once, Cape Cod four times, and Maine three times; these landscapes inspired his \"excursion\" books, A Yankee in Canada, Cape Cod, and The Maine Woods, in which travel itineraries frame his thoughts about geography, history and philosophy. Other travels took him southwest to Philadelphia and New York City in 1854 and west across the Great Lakes region in 1861, when he visited Niagara Falls, Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Mackinac Island.[56] He was provincial in his own travels, but he read widely about travel in other lands. He devoured all the first-hand travel accounts available in his day, at a time when the last unmapped regions of the earth were being explored. He read Magellan and James Cook; the arctic explorers John Franklin, Alexander Mackenzie and William Parry; David Livingstone and Richard Francis Burton on Africa; Lewis and Clark; and hundreds of lesser-known works by explorers and literate travelers.[57] Astonishing amounts of reading fed his endless curiosity about the peoples, cultures, religions and natural history of the world and left its traces as commentaries in his voluminous journals. He processed everything he read, in the local laboratory of his Concord experience. Among his famous aphorisms is his advice to \"live at home like a traveler.\"[58]\n",

      "After John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, many prominent voices in the abolitionist movement distanced themselves from Brown or damned him with faint praise. Thoreau was disgusted by this, and he composed a key speech, A Plea for Captain John Brown, which was uncompromising in its defense of Brown and his actions. Thoreau's speech proved persuasive: the abolitionist movement began to accept Brown as a martyr, and by the time of the American Civil War entire armies of the North were literally singing Brown's praises. As a biographer of Brown put it, \"If, as Alfred Kazin suggests, without John Brown there would have been no Civil War, we would add that without the Concord Transcendentalists, John Brown would have had little cultural impact.\"[59]\n",

      "Thoreau contracted tuberculosis in 1835 and suffered from it sporadically afterwards. In 1860, following a late-night excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm, he became ill with bronchitis.[60][61] His health declined, with brief periods of remission, and he eventually became bedridden. Recognizing the terminal nature of his disease, Thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works, particularly The Maine Woods and Excursions, and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of A Week and Walden. He wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue. His friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death. When his aunt Louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with God, Thoreau responded, \"I did not know we had ever quarreled.\"[62]\n",

      "Aware he was dying, Thoreau's last words were \"Now comes good sailing\", followed by two lone words, \"moose\" and \"Indian\".[63] He died on May 6, 1862, at age 44. Amos Bronson Alcott planned the service and read selections from Thoreau's works, and Channing presented a hymn.[64] Emerson wrote the eulogy spoken at the funeral.[65] Thoreau was buried in the Dunbar family plot; his remains and those of members of his immediate family were eventually moved to Sleepy Hollow Cemetery ( ) in Concord, Massachusetts.\n",

Thoreau's journals, which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death, were first published in 1906 and helped to build his modern reputation.[citation needed] A new, expanded edition of the journals is under way, published by Princeton University Press. Today, Thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost American writers, both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics. His memory is honored by the international Thoreau Society and his legacy honored by the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods, established in 1998 in Lincoln, Massachusetts.\n",

      "Thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and canoeing, of conserving natural resources on private land, and of preserving wilderness as public land. He was himself a highly skilled canoeist; Nathaniel Hawthorne, after a ride with him, noted that \"Mr. Thoreau managed the boat so perfectly, either with two paddles or with one, that it seemed instinct with his own will, and to require no physical effort to guide it.\" [67]\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not a strict vegetarian, though he said he preferred that diet[68] and advocated it as a means of self-improvement. He wrote in Walden, \"The practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble and filth.\"[69]\n",

      "\n",
      "Thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead he sought a middle ground, the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture. His philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in North America. He decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred \"partially cultivated country.\" His idea of being \"far in the recesses of the wilderness\" of Maine was to \"travel the logger's path and the Indian trail\", but he also hiked on pristine land. In the essay \"Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher\" Roderick Nash wrote, \"Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance.\"[70] Of alcohol, Thoreau wrote, \"I would fain keep sober always.... I believe that water is the only drink for a wise man; wine is not so noble a liquor.... Of all ebriosity, who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes?\"[69]\n",

      "Thoreau never married and was childless. He strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan. However, his sexuality has long been the subject of speculation, including by his contemporaries. Critics have called him heterosexual, homosexual, or asexual.[71][72] There is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone, man or woman. Some scholars have suggested that homoerotic sentiments run through his writings and concluded that he was homosexual.[71][73][74] The elegy Sympathy was inspired by the eleven-year-old Edmund Sewell, with whom he hiked for five days in 1839.[75] One scholar has suggested that he wrote the poem to Edmund because he could not bring himself to write it to Edmund's sister,[76] and another that Thoreau's \"emotional experiences with women are memorialized under a camouflage of masculine pronouns\",[77] but other scholars dismiss this.[71][78] It has been argued that the long paean in Walden to the French-Canadian woodchopper Alek Therien, which includes allusions to Achilles and Patroclus, is an expression of conflicted desire.[79] In some of Thoreau's writing there is the sense of a secret self.[80] In 1840 he writes in his journal: \"My friend is the apology for my life. In him are the spaces which my orbit traverses\".[81] Thoreau was strongly influenced by the moral reformers of his time, and this may have instilled anxiety and guilt over sexual desire.[82]\n",

      "Thoreau was fervently against slavery and actively supported the abolitionist movement.[1] He participated in the Underground Railroad, delivered lectures that attacked the Fugitive Slave Law, and in opposition to the popular opinion of the time, supported radical abolitionist militia leader John Brown and his party.[1] Two weeks after the ill-fated raid on Harpers Ferry and in the weeks leading up to Brown's execution, Thoreau regularly delivered a speech to the citizens of Concord, Massachusetts, in which he compared the American government to Pontius Pilate and likened Brown's execution to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ:\n",
      "\n",
      "Some eighteen hundred years ago Christ was crucified; this morning, perchance, Captain Brown was hung. These are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links. He is not Old Brown any longer; he is an angel of light.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "In The Last Days of John Brown, Thoreau described the words and deeds of John Brown as noble and an example of heroism.[83] In addition, he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed Brown and his scheme as \"crazy\".[83]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoreau was a proponent of limited government and individualism. Although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have, through self-betterment, the kind of government which \"governs not at all\", he distanced himself from contemporary \"no-government men\" (anarchists), writing: \"I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government.\"[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoreau deemed the evolution from absolute monarchy to limited monarchy to democracy as \"a progress toward true respect for the individual\" and theorized about further improvements \"towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man.\"[7] Echoing this belief, he went on to write: \"There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly.\"[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "It is on this basis that Thoreau could so strongly inveigh against British and Catholic power in A Yankee in Canada. Despotic authority had crushed the people's sense of ingenuity and enterprise; the Canadian habitants had been reduced, in his view, to a perpetual childlike state. Ignoring the recent Rebellions, he argued that there would be no revolution in the St. Lawrence River valley.[84][51]\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent (exemplified in his support for John Brown) and nonviolent (his own example of tax resistance displayed in Resistance to Civil Government), he regarded pacifist nonresistance as temptation to passivity,[85] writing: \"Let not our Peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords, or our inability to draw them from their scabbards; but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp.\"[85] Furthermore, in a formal lyceum debate in 1841, he debated the subject \"Is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance?\", arguing the affirmative.[86]\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, his condemnation of the Mexican–American War did not stem from pacifism, but rather because he considered Mexico \"unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army\" as a means to expand the slave territory.[87]\n",

      "Thoreau was ambivalent towards industrialization and capitalism. On one hand he regarded commerce as \"unexpectedly confident and serene, adventurous, and unwearied\"[3] and expressed admiration for its associated cosmopolitanism, writing:\n",

      "I am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me, and I smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign parts, of coral reefs, and Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the extent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will cover so many flaxen New England heads the next summer.[3]\n",

      "On the other hand, he wrote disparagingly of the factory system:\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoreau also favored bioregionalism, the protection of animals and wild areas, free trade, and taxation for schools and highways.[1] He disapproved of the subjugation of Native Americans, slavery, technological utopianism, consumerism, philistinism, mass entertainment, and frivolous applications of technology.[1]\n",

For example, in the first chapter (\"Economy\"), he writes: \"How much more admirable the Bhagvat-Geeta than all the ruins of the East!\"[3] American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who \"took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world\",[88] also a characteristic of Hinduism.\n",

I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Brahmin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges.[3]\n",

      "Additionally, Thoreau followed various Hindu customs, including following a diet of rice (\"It was fit that I should live on rice, mainly, who loved so well the philosophy of India.\"[3]), flute playing (reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of Krishna), and yoga.\n",

Depend upon it that, rude and careless as I am, I would fain practice the yoga faithfully. The yogi, absorbed in contemplation, contributes in his degree to creation; he breathes a divine perfume, he hears wonderful things. Divine forms traverse him without tearing him, and united to the nature which is proper to him, he goes, he acts as animating original matter.

      "Thoreau's political writings had little impact during his lifetime, as \"his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical,\" viewing him instead as a naturalist. They either dismissed or ignored his political essays, including Civil Disobedience. The only two complete books (as opposed to essays) published in his lifetime, Walden and A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849), both dealt with nature, in which he loved to wander.\"[16] His obituary was lumped in with others rather than as a separate article in an 1862 yearbook.[94] Nevertheless, Thoreau's writings went on to influence many public figures. Political leaders and reformers like Mohandas Gandhi, U.S. President John F. Kennedy, American civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, and Russian author Leo Tolstoy all spoke of being strongly affected by Thoreau's work, particularly Civil Disobedience, as did \"right-wing theorist Frank Chodorov [who] devoted an entire issue of his monthly, Analysis, to an appreciation of Thoreau.\"[95]\n",

White, Lewis Mumford,[97] Frank Lloyd Wright, Alexander Posey,[98] and Gustav Stickley.[99] Thoreau also influenced naturalists like John Burroughs, John Muir, E. O. Wilson, Edwin Way Teale, Joseph Wood Krutch, B. F. Skinner, David Brower, and Loren Eiseley, whom Publishers Weekly called \"the modern Thoreau\".[100] English writer Henry Stephens Salt wrote a biography of Thoreau in 1890, which popularized Thoreau's ideas in Britain: George Bernard Shaw, Edward Carpenter, and Robert Blatchford were among those who became Thoreau enthusiasts as a result of Salt's advocacy.[101] Mohandas Gandhi first read Walden in 1906 while working as a civil rights activist in Johannesburg, South Africa. He first read Civil Disobedience \"while he sat in a South African prison for the crime of nonviolently protesting discrimination against the Indian population in the Transvaal. The essay galvanized Gandhi, who wrote and published a synopsis of Thoreau's argument, calling its 'incisive logic [...] unanswerable' and referring to Thoreau as 'one of the greatest and most moral men America has produced'.\"[102][103] He told American reporter Webb Miller, \"[Thoreau's] ideas influenced me greatly. I adopted some of them and recommended the study of Thoreau to all of my friends who were helping me in the cause of Indian Independence.

      "Here, in this courageous New Englander's refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slavery's territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance. Fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I reread the work several times. I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement; indeed, they are more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a sit-in at lunch counters, a freedom ride into Mississippi, a peaceful protest in Albany, Georgia, a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, these are outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.[105]\n",

John Zerzan included Thoreau's text \"Excursions\" (1863) in his edited compilation of works in the anarcho-primitivist tradition titled Against civilization: Readings and reflections.[113] Additionally, Murray Rothbard, the founder of anarcho-capitalism, has opined that Thoreau was one of the \"great intellectual heroes\" of his movement.[95] Thoreau was also an important influence on late-19th-century anarchist naturism.[114][115] Globally, Thoreau's concepts also held importance within individualist anarchist circles[116][117] in Spain,[114][115][116] France,[116][118] and Portugal.[119]\n",

      "\n",
      "Nathaniel Hawthorne had mixed feelings about Thoreau. He noted that \"He is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which, I suspect, is almost as rare a character as even an original poet; and Nature, in return for his love, seems to adopt him as her especial child, and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness.\" [123] On the other hand, he also wrote that Thoreau \"repudiated all regular modes of getting a living, and seems inclined to lead a sort of Indian life among civilized men\".[124][125]\n",
      "\n",
      "In a similar vein, poet John Greenleaf Whittier detested what he deemed to be the \"wicked\" and \"heathenish\" message of Walden, claiming that Thoreau wanted man to \"lower himself to the level of a woodchuck and walk on four legs\".[126]\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to such criticisms, English novelist George Eliot, writing for the Westminster Review, characterized such critics as uninspired and narrow-minded:\n",

      "People—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every man's life ordered according to a particular pattern, and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them, may pooh-pooh Mr. Thoreau and this episode in his history, as unpractical and dreamy.[127]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work Walden by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries:\n",
      "\n",
      "I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. [...] Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; [...] I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.[128]\n",

This post will focus on types of tech debt I’ve seen during my time working at Riot, and a model for discussing it that we’re starting to use internally.

      "Impact\n",

      "The first axis is the most obvious: the impact of the debt. This takes the form of player-facing issues (bugs, missing features, unexpected behavior), and developer-facing issues (slower implementation, workflow issues, random useless shit to remember). It’s worth noting that “developer” in this case can be anyone of any discipline.

      "The second axis has to do with the cost to fix the tech debt. If we decide to fix an issue in our code or data, it will require someone’s measurable time to fix. If it’s a deeply rooted assumption that affects every line of code in the game, it may take weeks or months of engineering time. If it’s a dumb error in a single function, it may be fixable in a matter of minutes. Regardless of the time to implement a fix, though, we also must consider the risk of actually deploying that fix. Even a system I consider “wrong” can still be used as a tool to make a great game. If I change the way our scripting engine handles errors, or how particles compute their spawn time, that could break any of the 500+ spells on 140+ champions in the game.\n",

      "The third axis is something I’ve become obsessed with: contagion. If this tech debt is allowed to continue to exist, how much will it spread? That spreading can result from other systems interfacing with the afflicted system, from copy-pasting data built on top of the system, or from influencing the way other engineers will choose to implement new features.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a piece of tech debt is well-contained, the cost to fix it later compared to now is basically identical. You can weigh how much impact it has today when determining when a fix makes sense. If, on the other hand, a piece of tech debt is highly contagious, it will steadily become harder and harder to fix. What’s particularly gross about contagious tech debt is that its impact tends to increase as more and more systems become infected by the technical compromise at its core.\n",
      "\n",
      "Types of Debt\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have a framework for measuring a particular piece of tech debt, let’s talk about some broad categories of tech debt that I’ve seen on League of Legends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Local Debt\n",
      "\n",
      "Local debt resembles the classic “black box” model of programming. As far as the rest of the game is concerned, the local system (spell, network layer, script engine) works pretty reliably. No one needs to keep the debt in mind as they develop around the system. But if anyone opens the lid and looks inside, they’ll be horrified, disgusted, or completely confused by what they see.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can find a couple real world examples of local debt in your eyes. Due to how the eye is constructed, you see things upside down. More significantly, the retinal nerve creates a blind spot near the middle of each eye. This malformed data is sent to the visual centers of the brain, which must flip the image and fill the blind spots so the rest of the brain can interact with the “correct” image. These oddities are localized to the eye/optic nerve system and easily avoided by other systems, so they’re “good enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most famous instances of local debt in League of Legends is Jarvan’s Cataclysm, which is made of minions to this day. When designers need to attach gameplay effects to a location (or a set of locations), one of the tools available to them is the ability to spawn an “invisible minion.” RiotXypherous describes what I mean by “minion” here. These game objects are a stable and well-understood way to track and execute scripted logic. In cases like Jarvan’s wall, you need to spawn a high number of minions (24 to be precise) to make sure that no one can squeeze through the wall. An alternate solution could be a ring-terrain construct consisting of a single logical piece controlling the pathability of Cataclysm. If we took this approach, we could clean up the logic and slightly reduce computation cost. Let’s take a look at cataclysm using our impact, fix cost, and contagion model to see why a fix isn’t currently the best option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cataclysm Metrics\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Impact: 1 / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "Back when there were 12 minions, people would occasionally squeak through the wall, so Riot Exgeniar bumped it to 24. The fact that the wall is made of minions pretty much never influences any other developer as they make new content. (As an aside, the infamous “Jarvan Ult Hitch” was due to the confluence between this debt and a loading bug from trying to read missing auto-attack definitions.)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Fix cost: 2 / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "We don’t currently have the ability to composite shapes to create custom geometry without new code. If we wanted to create a ring shape to do an “area trigger” to more efficiently enforce Jarvan’s barrier, we would have to write some bespoke math to calculate collisions with a ring. We’re exploring Constructive Solid Geometry for other purposes, which may cataclysmically reduce the cost to fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Contagion: 1 / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "No one needs to take the implementation of Jarvan’s wall into account when developing features, which keeps it well contained. The one risk of contagion is other designers copy/pasting the implementation into their new champions (which has happened here and there). But as far as implementation problems go, the potential spread of Cataclysm is low and well understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a pretty typical shape for local debt. In general, local debt is defined by a low contagion score. If the impact is higher than the cost to fix, it tends to get fixed by a good citizen before too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "When considering whether to fix local debt, first ask yourself if it’s worth it. If the debt is truly not contagious, it should be safe to leave alone for as long as necessary. One of the biggest mistakes I observe is an instinct to jump on local debt that itches an engineer’s perfectionist side when it doesn’t have a broad enough impact to warrant the effort. If you do decide to make a fix, it’s usually easy to confirm the fix and regression test, due to the locality of the change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some recent examples of local debt that has been fixed include bugs with inhibitors causing champions to path towards 0,0,0 in certain circumstances, Janna’s Monsoon ignoring spell shields, and Tear of the Goddess stacking on manaless casts.\n",
      "\n",
      "MacGyver Debt\n",
      "\n",
      "MacGyver debt is named after the TV show from the mid 80s. Angus MacGyver would solve problems using his swiss army knife, duct tape, and whatever else was on hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "His solutions often involved attaching two unlikely pieces; in the context of tech debt, this means two conflicting systems are “duct-taped” together at their interface points throughout the codebase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seattle (among other cities) has a dramatic example of MacGyver debt as you can see above. The city used to have two competing settlements, each with its own grid. When those settlements grew into the modern Emerald City, the slightly different grids were mushed together, resulting in awkwardly shaped blocks and buildings and a less-than-efficient use of space. I’m particularly amused by the little shaved-off corner of the building in the bottom left.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best examples of MacGyver debt in the LoL codebase is the use of C++’s std::string vs. our custom AString class. Both are ways to store, modify, and pass around strings of characters. In general, we’ve found that std::string leads to lots of “hidden” memory allocations and performance costs, and makes it easy to write code that does bad things. AString is specifically designed with thoughtful memory management in mind. Our strategy for replacing std::string with AString was to allow both to exist in the codebase and provide conversions between the two (via .c_str() and .Get() respectively). We gave AString a number of ease-of-use improvements that make it easier to work with and encouraged engineers to replace std::string at their leisure as they change code. Thus, we’re slowly phasing std::string out and the “duct tape” interface between the two systems slowly shrinks as we tidy up more of our code.\n",
      "\n",
      "std::string vs AString Metrics\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Impact: 2 / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the high-impact allocations from std::string have been phased out via profiling, so at this point, the main cost is the small mental switching cost to convert from one system to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Fix cost: 3 / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversion to AString isn’t just a find-and-replace. There are a few flavors of AString for different purposes (AStackString for initial allocation in stack memory, ARefString for references to static strings, in addition to heap-allocated base AString). A real, thinking human needs to look at a replacement site to do it right. It will be a long, slow process to phase out the old system.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Contagion: -2 / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "By making AString easier to work with than std::string, we’ve actually managed to flip contagion to our side. Every time an engineer checks in a change to game code, there’s a chance that AString has spread further, like a virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest cost to most MacGyver debt tends to be the intellectual cost of switching modes when crossing boundaries. If some bug or feature is held back by being on the “wrong” system, a targeted move to the “right” system tends to be straightforward. The relative contagion of the new system vs. the old system is the key metric to keep an eye out for. If you can flip that balance to favor the new system, then the better system will inevitably win.\n",
      "\n",
      "When considering whether to fix MacGyver debt, try to find ways to make the (global) better system more desirable at a local level. If a time-pressured engineer making greedy optimizations during their day to day work chooses to move towards the desired end state, then you’re well on your way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other approach that can work is to do brute-force large-scale refactors. Depending on how closely the systems map, it may be possible to fix some or all of your MacGyver debt via clever regexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foundational Debt\n",
      "\n",
      "Foundational debt is when some assumption lies deep in the heart of your system and has been baked into the way the entire thing works. Foundational debt is sometimes hard to recognize for experienced users of a system because it’s seen as “just the way it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A hilariously stupid piece of real world foundational debt is the measurement system referred to as United States Customary Units. Having grown up in the US, my brain is filled with useless conversions, like that 5,280 feet are in a mile, and 2 pints are in a quart, while 4 quarts are in a gallon. The US government has considered switching to metric multiple times, but we remain one of seven countries that haven’t adopted Système International as the official measurement system. This debt is baked into road signs, recipes, elementary schools, and human minds.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve talked about several of the big pieces of foundational debt that Riot has been tackling in previous Tech Blog articles like Determinism in League of Legends and Game Data Server.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example of foundational debt that I think about a lot is our use of the lua scripting language. Designers on League use a tool called BlockBuilder to create complex behaviors by stringing together blocks of functionality like getting the distance between points, spawning minions, dealing damage, or doing all manner of script flow control. The set of operations designers choose from is varied but limited, and the parameters for each operation are constrained. Yet long long ago, in the prehistory of League of Legends, the decision was made not to store the blocks and parameters in a simple, constrained format that matches the data. Instead they’re stored as arrays and tables in the powerful, beautiful, and entirely-too-complex-for-this-purpose lua language. A decade or so of game development took place upon that foundation since we made the decision and now manipulating lua objects is one of the most common operations in the engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "BlockBuilder Lua Metrics\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Impact: 4 / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "The mismatch between lua and this problem space has many costs. Every callstack is polluted with ~6 marshalling stack frames for each frame of BlockBuilder logic. Those marshalling operations are not cheap in terms of server CPU usage. Reading diffs of script changes is needlessly difficult. Parsing/searching script files to determine functionality requires a fairly in-depth understanding of the lua language.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Fix cost: 4 / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "Since lua is so deeply embedded into the engine, digging it out would be difficult. A current proposal is to create a wrapper class that behaves like the lua objects, but is a much simpler struct under the hood, so we can steadily morph our scripting innards into something more suitable. But any way we approach it, we’ll need to be careful and thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Contagion: 4 / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time a system bumps up against scripting (which is the core unit of logic for LoL), that system will be shaped by the operations and requirements of the lua backend. We average a new Building Block every ~3-4 days, each of which directly manipulates lua objects. The longer we don’t replace lua, the harder it becomes to replace lua.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foundational debt tends to index highly on all three axes. The high cost encourages sticking with the janky system, which is often the right call, but the high impact and high contagion mean that fixing egregious foundational debt can have a huge payoff.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common strategy for fixing foundational debt that I’ve observed at Riot is to stand up the new system alongside the old one. If possible, I recommend then converting the foundational debt to MacGyver debt by slowly porting systems over to using the new system with conversion operations available to cross between new and old. This allows you to start reaping the benefits in targeted areas easily while limiting exposure to risk. Sometimes such a conversion isn’t possible, though. In that case, creating a compile time (or if possible, loading time) switch can help build confidence in the new system without forcing you to go all-in. The former is in use for the GDS conversion, and the latter worked for Determinism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Debt\n",
      "\n",
      "Data debt starts with a piece of tech debt from one of the other categories. Perhaps it’s a bug in the scripting system, a less-than-desirable file format for items, or two systems that don’t play very well with each other. But then a ton of content (art, scripts, sounds, etc.) gets built on top of that code deficiency. Before too long, fixing the initial tech debt becomes extremely risky and it becomes painfully hard to tell what you’ll break if you try to fix anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite real world example for understanding data debt is DNA. The genome of an organism is slowly built up over millions of years through lossy copies (mutations), transcription errors, and evolutionary pressure. Some copy errors are useless but benign, others are harmful, and others confer powerful advantages. Attempting to figure out what any piece of DNA actually does is incredibly difficult. We fully understand what the base pairs mean, and how sets of base pairs translate into amino acids for protein construction. We are even starting to understand more about some non-encoding roles that DNA can play. But in the 3 billion plus base pairs of the human genome, there’s still so much we don’t even remotely understand. Radiolab’s episode about CRISPR highlights one such puzzle that was recently cracked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data debt on League of Legends is most impactful when it turns an otherwise trivial fix into a grueling ordeal. I will share one tiny example, but trust me: data debt is one of the most crucial considerations when making changes to the LoL engine. Our game engineers develop deep knowledge of how game systems were implemented and become quite skilled at predicting what data may break when they change some piece of code.\n",
      "\n",
      "A memorable piece of data debt that we fixed a few years ago involved block parameters in our BlockBuilder scripting language. Above, you can see a toy example where I try to increase Owner’s armor by a variable plus a constant. I would expect Owner to receive 25 bonus armor: 20 from the variable Delta, which is passed into the block, and 5 from the constant. Since the variable’s name matches the parameter name, however, this used to yield 40. (Don’t even ask me why it wouldn’t yield 45; I have no idea what thought process led to the early-out.)\n",
      "\n",
      "When NoopMoney, an engineer on Champions team, went to fix this nonsensical behavior, all he had to do was delete 4 lines of code. But with a highly contagious piece of debt like this, even a small change requires thorough planning. Any of 400,000 lines of script in LoL might have any of their numerical parameters being doubled by this bug. What’s worse, those scripts are “behaving correctly” in that the game is balanced and tuned around those potentially doubled values. NoopMoney had to make the fix toggleable on Live (in case we had any unexpected bugs come up) in addition to doing extensive regex searching and QA sweeps to try to identify which scripts might rely on this bug to function properly. In the end, the problems from fixing this bug were fairly minor; a small handful of champions needed their scripts altered. But the data debt made it difficult to predict.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parameter Naming Bug Metrics\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Impact: 2 / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "This bug’s impact was small when it occurred. It doubled a passed-in value, and potentially discarded a constant. But it became just yet another bit of otherwise useless tribal knowledge that designers and engineers needed to carry around (once they became aware of it). Developer mindshare is a valuable resource to be wasted like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Fix cost: 2 / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "All told, the fix was straightforward. By creating a live feature toggle, we were able to increase our confidence in the safety of the fix. The most expensive part was the initial screening to try to evaluate the scope of the problem in order to target testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Contagion: 4 / 5\n",
      "\n",
      "The unfortunate thing about this bug was that it preyed on an extremely logical behavior. If, for example, you want to deal damage to a unit, saving the value in a variable called “Damage” is totally logical. Sadly, though, the ApplyDamage block took in the amount in a parameter of the same name, thus triggering the bug. Then, if someone else wants to make a similar spell, they’d copy/paste your blocks and carry on, thus spreading the bug even farther.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, data debt indexes high on cost to fix since it makes changes hard to evaluate. More worryingly, it’s almost always extraordinarily contagious due to a few properties of data (as opposed to code). First, it’s generally acceptable to create a new piece of data with a copy/paste of an existing piece of data. If you’re making a new skillshot spell, starting with Ezreal’s Mystic Shot can save you tons of time. Any issues with an existing piece of data are propagated out to its descendents. Second, data is rarely subjected to technical review akin to code reviews. This makes it difficult to notice and halt the spread of bad practices even if they’re widely known. Finally, fixing any issue in the data typically requires a human being with eyes and a brain to verify - a compiler and formal logic won’t cut it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When fixing data debt, I’ve observed two main approaches. The first I call the “do it right checkbox.” This means making a toggle between the old “broken” behavior and the new “fixed” behavior for data creators. Ideally, you make the fixed version default while you make sure old content uses the broken version. Then, like with MacGyver debt, you can do a slow and steady replacement to get things onto the new version. This has a permanent cost of adding more and more crap to your editing UI.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second approach is the “just fix the damn thing” approach, like NoopMoney used on the parameter naming bug. This means fixing the bug and then trying to repair all the data that’s meaningfully affected. Several techniques can make this less terrifying. First is doing a lot of greps and regex searching to try to understand the theoretical impact. Second is a bunch of targeted testing. Finally, you can prepare a toggle to enable reverting to the old behavior once the fix ships in case you missed something worse than the bug you’re fixing. It’s worth noting that Determinism helps us a lot with testing for these types of changes by letting us confirm that the server produces the same results before and after a change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "When measuring a piece of tech debt, you can use impact (to customers and to developers), fix cost (time and risk), and contagion. I believe most developers regularly consider impact and fix cost, while I’ve rarely encountered discussions of contagion. Contagion can be a developer’s worst enemy as a problem burrows in and becomes harder and harder to dislodge. It is possible, however, to turn contagion into a weapon by making your fix more contagious than the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Working on League, most of the tech debt I’ve seen falls into one of the 4 categories I’ve presented here. Local debt, like a black box of gross. MacGyver debt, where 2 or more systems are duct-taped together with conversion functions. Foundational debt, when the entire structure is built on some unfortunate assumptions. Data debt, when enormous quantities of data are piled on some other type of debt, making it risky and time-consuming to fix.\n",

      "The Internal Revenue Service has been urging tax preparation firms to step up their cybersecurity efforts this year, warning that identity thieves and hackers increasingly are targeting certified public accountants (CPAs) in a bid to siphon oodles of sensitive personal and financial data on taxpayers. This is the story of a CPA in New Jersey whose compromise by malware led to identity theft and phony tax refund requests filed on behalf of his clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, KrebsOnSecurity was alerted by security expert Alex Holden of Hold Security about a malware gang that appears to have focused on CPAs. The crooks in this case were using a Web-based keylogger that recorded every keystroke typed on the target’s machine, and periodically uploaded screenshots of whatever was being displayed on the victim’s computer screen at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve never seen one of these keyloggers in action, viewing their output can be a bit unnerving. This particular malware is not terribly sophisticated, but nevertheless is quite effective. It not only grabs any data the victim submits into Web-based forms, but also captures any typing — including backspaces and typos as we can see in the screenshot below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whoever was running this scheme had all victim information uploaded to a site that was protected from data scraping by search engines, but the site itself did not require any form of authentication to view data harvested from victim PCs. Rather, the stolen information was indexed by victim and ordered by day, meaning anyone who knew the right URL could view each day’s keylogging record as one long image file.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those records suggest that this particular CPA — “John,” a New Jersey professional whose real name will be left out of this story — likely had his computer compromised sometime in mid-March 2018 (at least, this is as far back as the keylogging records go for John).\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s also not clear exactly which method the thieves used to get malware on John’s machine. Screenshots for John’s account suggest he routinely ignored messages from Microsoft and other third party Windows programs about the need to apply critical security updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "More likely, however, John’s computer was compromised by someone who sent him a booby-trapped email attachment or link. When one considers just how frequently CPAs must need to open Microsoft Office and other files submitted by clients and potential clients via email, it’s not hard to imagine how simple it might be for hackers to target and successfully compromise your average CPA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The keylogging malware itself appears to have been sold (or perhaps directly deployed) by a cybercriminal who uses the nickname ja_far. This individual markets a $50 keylogger product alongside a malware “crypting” service that guarantees his malware will be undetected by most antivirus products for a given number of days after it is used against a victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems likely that ja_far’s keylogger was the source of this data because at one point — early in the morning John’s time — the attacker appears to have accidentally pasted ja_far’s jabber instant messenger address into the victim’s screen instead of his own. In all likelihood, John’s assailant was seeking additional crypting services to ensure the keylogger remained undetected on John’s PC. A couple of minutes later, the intruder downloaded a file to John’s PC from file-sharing site sendspace.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I found remarkable about John’s situation was despite receiving notice after notice that the IRS had rejected many of his clients’ tax returns because those returns had already been filed by fraudsters, for at least two weeks John does not appear to have suspected that his compromised computer was likely the source of said fraud inflicted on his clients (or if he did, he didn’t share this notion with any of his friends or family via email).\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, John composed and distributed to his clients a form letter about their rejected returns, and another letter that clients could use to alert the IRS and New Jersey tax authorities of suspected identity fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then again, perhaps John ultimately did suspect that someone had commandeered his machine, because on March 30 he downloaded and installed Spyhunter 4, a security product by Enigma Software designed to detect spyware, keyloggers and rootkits, among other malicious software.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spyhunter appears to have found ja_far’s keylogger, because shortly after the malware alert pictured above popped up on John’s screen, the Web-based keylogging service stopped recording logs from his machine. John did not respond to requests for comment (via phone).\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s unlikely John’s various clients who experience(d) identity fraud, tax refund fraud or account takeovers as a result of his PC infection will ever learn the real reason for the fraud. I opted to keep his name out of this story because I thought the experience documented and explained here would be eye opening enough and I have no particular interest in ruining his business.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a new type of identity theft that the IRS first warned about this year involving CPAs would be very difficult for a victim CPA to conceal. Identity thieves who specialize in tax refund fraud have been busy of late hacking online accounts at multiple tax preparation firms and using them to file phony refund requests. Once the IRS processes the return and deposits money into bank accounts of the hacked firms’ clients, the crooks contact those clients posing as a collection agency and demand that the money be “returned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "If you go to file your taxes electronically this year and the return is rejected, it may mean fraudsters have beat you to it. The IRS advises taxpayers in this situation to follow the steps outlined in the Taxpayer Guide to Identity Theft. Those unable to file electronically should mail a paper tax return along with Form 14039 (PDF) — the Identity Theft Affidavit — stating they were victims of a tax preparer data breach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tax professionals might consider using something other than Microsoft Windows to manage their client’s data. I’ve long dispensed this advice for people in charge of handling payroll accounts for small- to mid-sized businesses. I continue to stand by this advice not because there isn’t malware that can infect Mac or Linux-based systems, but because the vast majority of malicious software out there today still targets Windows computers, and you don’t have to outrun the bear — only the next guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many readers involved in handling corporate payroll accounts have countered that this advice is impractical for people who rely on multiple Windows-based programs to do their jobs. These days, however, most systems and services needed to perform accounting (and CPA) tasks can be used across multiple operating systems — mainly because they are now Web-based and rely instead on credentials entered at some cloud service (e.g., UltraTax, QuickBooks, or even Microsoft’s Office 365).\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally, users still must be on guard against phishing scams that try to trick people into divulging credentials to these services, but when your entire business of managing other people’s money and identities can be undone by a simple keylogger, it’s a good idea to do whatever you can to keep from becoming the next malware victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the IRS, fraudsters are using spear phishing attacks to compromise computers of tax pros. In this scheme, the “criminal singles out one or more tax preparers in a firm and sends an email posing as a trusted source such as the IRS, a tax software provider or a cloud storage provider. Thieves also may pose as clients or new prospects. The objective is to trick the tax professional into disclosing sensitive usernames and passwords or to open a link or attachment that secretly downloads malware enabling the thieves to track every keystroke.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The IRS warns that some tax professionals may be unaware they are victims of data theft, even long after all of their clients’ data has been stolen by digital intruders. Here are some signs there might be a problem:\n",

      "I’m commiserating with a friend who recently left the technology industry to return to entertainment. “I’m not a programmer,” he begins, explaining some of the frustrations of his former workplace, before correcting himself, “—oh, engineer, in tech-bro speak. Though to me, engineers are people who build bridges and follow pretty rigid processes for a reason.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His indictment touches a nerve. In the Silicon Valley technology scene, it’s common to use the bare term “engineer” to describe technical workers. Somehow, everybody who isn’t in sales, marketing, or design became an engineer. “We’re hiring engineers,” read startup websites, which could mean anything from Javascript programmers to roboticists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The term is probably a shortening of “software engineer,” but its use betrays a secret: “Engineer” is an aspirational title in software development. Traditional engineers are regulated, certified, and subject to apprenticeship and continuing education. Engineering claims an explicit responsibility to public safety and reliability, even if it doesn’t always deliver.\n",

      "Recent years have seen prominent failures in software. Massive data breaches at Target, Home Depot, BlueCross BlueShield, Anthem, Harvard University, LastPass, and Ashley Madison only scratch the surface of the cybersecurity issues posed by today’s computer systems. The Volkswagen diesel-emissions exploit was caused by a software failing, even if it seems to have been engineered, as it were, deliberately.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these problems are just the most urgent and most memorable. Today’s computer systems pose individual and communal dangers that we’d never accept in more concrete structures like bridges, skyscrapers, power plants, and missile-defense systems. Apple’s iOS 9 update reportedly “bricked” certain phones, making them unusable. Services like Google Docs go down for mysterious reasons, leaving those whose work depends on them in a lurch. “Your password contains invalid characters,” a popular tweet quotes from an anonymous website, before twisting the dagger, “No, your startup contains incompetent engineers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These might seem like minor matters compared to the structural integrity of your office building or the security of our nation’s nuclear-weapons arsenal. But then consider how often your late-model car fails to start inexplicably or your office elevator traps you inside its shaft. Computing has become infrastructure, but it doesn’t work like infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to skyscrapers and bridges and power plants and elevators and the like, engineering has been, and will continue to be, managed partly by professional standards, and partly by regulation around the expertise and duties of engineers. But fifty years’ worth of attempts to turn software development into a legitimate engineering practice have failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as the heavy industry can greenwash to produce the appearance of environmental responsibility and the consumer industry can pinkwash to connect themselves to cause marketing, so the technology industry can “engineerwash”—leveraging the legacy of engineering in order to make their products and services appear to engender trust, competence, and service in the public interest.\n",

      "By the 1960s, large national-defense systems were largely managed by computers. But the creation of such systems was a disaster—almost everything was delivered late, over budget, and with unnecessary complexity. Late in the decade, the NATO Science Committee sponsored two conferences dedicated to establishing an engineering approach to software creation. The 1968 conference report shows that the notion was still aspirational:\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase “software engineering” was deliberately chosen as being provocative, in implying the need for software manufacture to be based on the types of theoretical foundations and practical disciplines, that are traditional in the established branches of engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Commercial applications meant to service ordinary people, from inventory control to airline reservations to banking, needed to be reliable. Programming merely involved implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software-engineering trends came and went during the ensuing decades. Structured programming paradigms of the 1960s, meant to make software development more predictable and less risky, gave way to the object-oriented paradigm of the ‘80s and ‘90s, meant to make programming better mirror the business processes it facilitates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the overall challenges of software engineering became more familiar and more entrenched. A decade after his 1975 intervention The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering, Fred Brooks lamented that little had changed. In response, he proposed incremental development, or prototyping. Today’s software development is iterative, and for good reason: Software wasn’t ever really akin to manufacturing and construction, where changes were difficult or impossible after initial implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computing is turning engineering into a type of speculative finance rather than a calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, software was never not akin to manufacturing and construction, either. Almost 50 years after the NATO Science Committee conferences, some of its participants’ warnings still hold. “In the competitive rush to make available the latest techniques,” the ’68 report opines, “we strive to take great forward leaps across gulfs of unknown width and depth.” The same sentiment still holds today.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what happened? The personal-computer revolution, for one. In the 1960s and ’70s, computers were expensive and scarce. They were confined to research, in governmental, corporate, and industrial contexts. But with the rise of the microcomputer in the late 1970s, anyone could own, use, and program one.\n",
      "\n",
      "This democratization of software development ignited the consumer and business-software revolution. But it also changed the stakes of software engineering. Developing Microsoft Excel or the back-office systems at American Airlines was hardly glamorous or fast-paced. A giant product like a spreadsheet or a reservation system was still something like a bridge or a building: It had to work right, especially since patches and revisions were expensive and required physical intervention. Such cases require an engineering approach, while trying one’s hand at a program for upload to the local BBS (or the modern app store) does not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The informality of software development accelerated even more with the rise of the web, starting in the mid ‘90s and continuing through today. As software services moved to websites, smartphones, and the Cloud, two things happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the pressure to get things right the first time around was relieved, because updates and changes could be applied centrally, as in the mainframe era. Over time, the ease of rapid repair became an excuse for rapid development, and Brooks-style prototyping mutated into the constant software updates we experience today. Facebook has wisely retired its one-time internal-development philosophy, “move fast and break things,” but no business reliant on civil or structural engineering would ever have adopted such a motto in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "And second, software became more isolated from the world, even as it became more predominant. Earlier computing systems were imbricated with other aspects of business, industry, government, and society. An automobile customer-management system has to integrate with dealers, suppliers, shippers, banks and lenders, regulators, legacy systems, and customers. But today’s software mostly stands alone. Instagram, a photo-sharing service valued at $35 billion last year, just uploads and downloads images between its servers and its app.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, today’s Cloud-connected tools still rely on infrastructures, especially the physical servers and networks that handle millions of users accessing billions of files. But those activities have largely been outsourced to infrastructure giants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, integrations with messaging, financials, and storage have been abstracted such that individual software developers can treat them as black boxes. That sometimes allows software to run better and more reliably, but it also allows developers to avoid interfacing with the messy world outside their co-working spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, software development has become institutionally hermetic. And that’s the opposite of what “engineering” ought to mean: a collaboration with the world, rather than a separate domain bent on overtaking it.\n",
      "\n",
      "* * *\n",
      "\n",
      "The traditional disciplines of engineering—civil, mechanical, aerospace, chemical, electrical, environmental—are civic professions as much as technical ones. Engineers orchestrate the erection of bridges and buildings; they design vehicles and heavy machinery; they invent and realize the energy systems that drive this equipment; and they contrive methods for connecting all of these systems together.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s no accident that the most truly engineered of software-engineering projects extend well beyond the computer. Autonomous-vehicle design offers the most obvious contemporary example. When Google designs self-driving cars, it musters its own computational systems, like mapping and navigation. But it also integrates those into a world much larger than browsers and smartphones and data centers. Autonomous vehicles share the roads with human-driven cars, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Those roads are managed, maintained, and regulated. Self-driving cars also interface with federal motor-vehicle standards and regulations, along with all the other material demands and foibles of a machine made of metal and plastic and rubber rather than bits. Engineering addresses complex, large-scale systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why it is so infuriating when Uber insists that it is just a technology platform, and thus not subject to the oversight of transportation-services regulation. Love or hate it, Uber is not just an app developer—it’s a car-service network activated by software, and thus subject to public interest and oversight. And no matter what Uber says, the company still advertises careers in “engineering, design, and product” categories on its website. Engineering roles are illustrated by a bearded guy staring at source code on two monitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uber Screenshot\n",
      "\n",
      "Other engineering disciplines are subject to certification and licensure. If you’ve ever hired a civil, structural, or hydraulic engineer for a construction or repair project, that individual probably had to be certified as a Professional Engineer (PE). Licensing processes vary by state, but Professional Engineers generally need to hold a 4-year degree from an accredited program in their discipline, pass one or more exams, and possess 4 or more years of professional experience under the supervision of a licensed engineer. Not all working engineers are or need to be Professional Engineers, but to open an engineering consulting practice or to claim that one is an “engineer” in a formal context, licensure is usually required. It’s in the state’s interest to ensure that someone claiming to be an engineer (or an architect a surveyor or a cosmetologist or a massage therapist) isn’t just making up his or her qualifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professional Engineering certification is usually offered only in fields where something could go terribly, horribly wrong with unqualified actors at the helm. California, for example, issues Professional licenses for agricultural, chemical, civil, control system, electrical, fire protection, industrial, mechanical, metallurgical, nuclear, petroleum engineering, and traffic engineers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2013, the National Council of Examiners of Engineers and Surveyors (NCEES), which all 50 states use for licensure examination, began offering testing for software engineers. The exams were produced in collaboration with the IEEE, who maintains a Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK).\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s unlikely that Silicon Valley workers would pursue such a license. For one, software engineers are unlikely to open a private office like a structural engineer might do. Even if all engineers are supposed to work under a licensed engineer to use the name, at big companies, many do so under layers of management.\n",
      "\n",
      "The information-technology industry simply doesn’t value certification as much as engineering does, or even as much as IT once did. Silicon Valley bigwigs like Peter Thiel have been flouting formal degrees for years, and even big companies like Google have indicated that they don’t value a college degree over and above the ability to do whatever work Google decides is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "But by definition, “engineering” has traditionally entailed the completion of an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)-approved 4-year degree. ABET’s accreditation requirements for computer science are vague, but they do expect “an ability to apply design and development principles in the construction of software systems of varying complexity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Accredited computer-science programs might be moving further away from software engineering anyway. Agile software development has become predominant, focused on rapid iteration rather than long-term planning and intricate documentation. One popular agile method is Scrum, which is focused on short “sprints” toward a series of changing goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineers bear a burden to the public, and their specific expertise emanates from that responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lightweight approaches like Scrum are more compatible with the fast-moving marketplace of computer technology. An app or a web service isn’t a bridge or a building. Software is temporary, and provisionalism is considered a feature, not a bug. But at the same time, the stakes of software development are becoming akin to that of bridges and buildings. Not only do computers run our cars and airplanes and medical devices, but also our banking systems, health-care organizations, insurance-underwriting practices, telephony and communication networks—even our social and entertainment activities. And even if successful, methodologies like Scrum never allow that infrastructure to stabilize. Some new tweak can be made, some new feature can always be added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, start-up culture is changing engineering education anyway. Entrepreneurship is exalted. Accelerators and incubators abound. Not all students in computer-science programs think they’ll become startup billionaires… But not all of them don’t think so, either. Would-be “engineers” are encouraged to think of every project as a potential business ready to scale and sell, rather than as a process of long-term training in disciplines where concerns for social welfare become paramount. Engineering has always been a well-paid profession, but computing is turning it into a type of speculative finance rather than a calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "* * *\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) calls the “engineers” who work at Google and Uber and Facebook and its ilk “Computer Programmers” or “Software Developers.” The former write code, the latter design systems. Nobody has to follow the BLS’s definitions, and you can understand why more grandiose titles would be appealing to Silicon Valley disruptors. “Engineer” conjures the image of the hard-hat-topped designer-builder, carefully crafting tomorrow. But such an aspiration is rarely realized by computing. The respectability of engineering, a feature built over many decades of closely controlled, education- and apprenticeship-oriented certification, becomes reinterpreted as a fast-and-loose commitment to craftwork as business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineerwashing entails a shift from the noun to the verbal sense of “engineer.” An engineer is a professional who designs, builds, and maintains systems. But to engineer means skillfully, artfully, or even deviously contriving an outcome. To engineer is to jury-rig, to get something working more or less, for a time. Sufficiently enough that it serves an immediately obvious purpose, but without concern or perhaps even awareness of its longevity. Engineering in this sense embodies MacGyver scrappiness, a doggedness compatible with today’s values of innovative disruption. But then, no reasonable person would want MacGyver building their bridges or buildings. Or software!\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps software calamities like data breaches and dieselgate will raise the hackles of the public, such that the standards for software development will be revealed and, in time, reformed. But given the difficulty of renewing, creating, or enforcing more urgent regulatory oversight over the technology industry, the job titles of technology workers probably seems like a minor matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as Silicon Valley has deftly reframed its business interests as a process of “changing the world,” so it has also reframed engineering as a process of building something temporary. After all, professionals like graphic designers and hedge-fund managers also build things, but we don’t normally call them engineers (brand engineering? speculation engineering?). They do work that might or might not be infrastructural, and that might or might not be conducted in the public interest. And those latter matters are what separate engineering from mere business or craft.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of which leads us back to the bridges to which my friend negatively compared his “engineer” colleagues. In Canada, many civil engineers wear an iron ring symbolizing the ethical commitment their profession undertakes. The ring is proffered in a ceremony called the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer, in which an oath penned by Rudyard Kipling is recited. It reads, in part, “My Time I will not refuse; my Thought I will not grudge; my Care I will not deny toward the honour, use, stability and perfection of any works to which I may be called to set my hand.” (The U.S. Order of the Engineer offers a similar but less poetic rendition of the oath and the ring.)\n",
      "\n",
      "A persistent legend holds that the rings are forged from steel reclaimed from the Quebec Bridge, which collapsed catastrophically upon construction in 1907, killing dozens of workers. Though false, the myth still holds up allegorically. Even if it doesn’t embody it, the Iron Ring’s steel represents the Quebec Bridge, and every other. Engineers bear a burden to the public, and their specific expertise as designers and builders of bridges or buildings—or software—emanates from that responsibility. Only after answering this calling does an engineer build anything, whether bridges or buildings or software.\n",

      "Executive summary http://bfy.tw/HJvH 2018 Data Breach Investigations Report Your organization’s security depends on you. Data breaches aren’t just a problem for security professionals. The impact is felt across the whole business—from your legal team, embroiled in litigation, to your frontline employees, who can’t access the tools they need to do their jobs. Everyone needs to play their part in managing the risks. But first you need to understand what you’re up against. You need confidence in your security if you’re going to get the most from the latest digital innovations. That’s why, every year, we publish the Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) —this is our 11th edition. Each report is based on analysis of thousands of real-world incidents—over 53,000 this year, including 2,216 confirmed data breaches. 53,308 security incidents, 2,216 data breaches, 65 countries, 67 contributors. This year we saw, yet again, that cybercriminals are still finding success with the same tried and tested techniques, and their victims are still making the same mistakes. Let’s start you on the path to improved security by examining who has you in their sights, what they’re after and how they plan to get their hands on it. It will probably be you one day Most cybercriminals are motivated by cold, hard cash. If there’s some way they can make money out of you, they will. That could mean stealing payment card data, personally identifiable information or your intellectual property. And they don’t care who they take it from. Ignore the stereotype of sophisticated cybercriminals targeting billion-dollar businesses. Most attacks are opportunistic and target not the wealthy or famous, but the unprepared. 76% of breaches were financially motivated. So who are you up against? Almost three-quarters (73%) of cyberattacks were perpetrated by outsiders. Members of organized criminal groups were behind half of all breaches, with nation-state or state-affiliated actors involved in 12%. Not all the baddies are outsiders though. Over a quarter (28%) of attacks involved insiders. The insider threat can be particularly difficult to guard against—it’s hard to spot the signs if someone is using their legitimate access to your data for nefarious purposes. The motives behind attacks (percentage of breaches) Financial 60% 40% 20% Espionage Fun Ideology Convenience 2013 80% 60% 40% Other 2014 80% 60% 40% 20% 80% 60% Year after year, financial heads the list of motives. 40% 20% 2015 2016 Grudge 2 People make mistakes Don’t get held to ransom Malicious employees looking to line their pockets aren’t the only insider threat you face. Errors were at the heart of almost one in five (17%) breaches. That included employees failing to shred confidential information, sending an email to the wrong person or misconfiguring web servers. While none of these were deliberately ill-intentioned, they could all still prove costly. 4% of people will click on any given phishing campaign. Cybercriminals don’t have to steal data to make money—they can just stop you using it. We first saw ransomware rear its ugly head in the 2013 DBIR. In this year’s report, it’s the most prevalent variety of malware. Ransomware is the top variety of malicious software, found in 39% of cases where malware was identified. This is something we’ve been saying for the last three years, and sadly it’s still true today—people are still falling for phishing campaigns. The good news is that 78% of people don’t click on a single phishing campaign all year. But, on average, 4% of the targets in any given phishing campaign will click it. And incredibly, the more phishing emails someone has clicked, the more likely they are to do so again. You have 16 minutes until the first click on a phishing campaign. The first report from a savvy user will arrive after 28 minutes. Why has ransomware become so commonplace? Because it’s easy to deploy and can be very effective—you don’t have to be a master criminal; off-the-shelf toolkits allow any amateur to create and deploy ransomware in a matter of minutes. There’s little risk or cost involved and there’s no need to monetize stolen data. Increasingly, cybercriminals aren’t looking to just encrypt single user devices. They can do much more damage, and make much more money, if they can encrypt a file server or database. If you aren’t backed up, they could take your business offline.

Each industry faces a different mix of threats. By understanding the biggest threats to your industry, you’ll be able to make best use of your security budget and mitigate the risks. We report on the threats facing nine industries in this year’s DBIR—you can see a summary of the findings below. If your sector isn’t there, that doesn’t mean you’re safe; it just means we didn’t have a large enough pool of data to enable us to provide valid insights. The 2018 DBIR provides a lot more detail on the threats facing each industry, as well as guidance on the steps you can take to manage the risks. Accommodation Who What How 99% external, 1% internal 93% payment, 5% personal, 2% credentials 93% hacking, 91% malware Breaches ’15 ’16 ’17 It’s pretty clear-cut where you need to focus. 90% of all breaches involved POS intrusions. In fact, you’re over 100 times more likely than the median industry in our dataset to have a POS controller targeted. Number of incidents and breaches by sector Education Accommodation 368 338 breaches 368 incidents Education 101 292 Financial 146 598 Healthcare 536 Information 109 1,040 Manufacturing 71 536 Professional 132 540 540 750 Public 304 Retail 169 s e h c a e r B 317 22,788 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Who What How 81% external, 19% internal 72% personal, 14% secrets, 11% medical 46% hacking, 41% social Breaches ’15 ’16 ’17 Social engineering scams are targeting your employees’ personal information, which is then used to commit identity fraud. Your highly sensitive research is also at risk—20% of attacks were motivated by espionage. But sometimes the threats aren’t about stealing data for financial gain—11% of attacks have “fun” as their motive. Financial Who What How 79% external, 19% internal 36% personal, 34% payment, 13% bank 34% hacking, 34% physical Breaches ’15 ’16 ’17 You still need to be alert to payment card skimmers installed on ATMs by organized criminal groups. Now there’s ATM jackpotting too, where software or hardware is installed to make the ATM spit out money. There’s also still a very real threat that denial of service attacks could disrupt your operations. 4 Healthcare Professional Who What How 43% external, 56% internal 79% medical, 37% personal, 4% payment 35% error, 24% misuse Breaches ’15 ’16 ’17 Who What How 70% external, 31% internal 56% personal, 28% credentials, 16% internal 50% hacking, 21% social Breaches ’15 ’16 ’17 Healthcare is the only industry where the threat from inside is greater than that from outside. Human error is a major contributor to those stats. Employees are also abusing their access to systems or data, although in 13% of cases, it’s driven by fun or curiosity—for example, where a celebrity has recently been a patient. Attacks are typically financially motivated and often involve phishing or the use of stolen credentials. There’s also a danger from your employees making mistakes. While data is typically compromised in hours or less, it can be days before a breach is discovered—typically by a third party. Information Public Who What How 74% external, 23% internal 56% personal, 41% credentials, 9% internal 57% hacking, 26% error Breaches ’15 ’16 ’17 Web application attacks, most often using stolen credentials, are a major issue. Employee error is also having an impact—typically due to misconfigured databases or publishing errors. But perhaps the biggest threat you face is from denial of service attacks—they account for 56% of the incidents witnessed in 2017. Who What How 67% external, 34% internal 41% personal, 24% secrets, 14% medical 52% hacking, 32% social Breaches ’15 ’16 ’17 Cyberespionage remains a major concern—espionage was a motive for 44% of breaches. Attacks usually involve phishing, installations and the use of backdoors or C2 channels. But it’s not just state secrets being targeted— the personal data you hold on citizens and employees is also at risk. Manufacturing Retail Who What How 89% external, 13% internal 32% personal, 30% secrets, 24% credentials 66% hacking, 34% malware Breaches ’15 ’16 ’17 Who What How 91% external, 10% internal 73% payment, 16% personal, 8% credentials 46% hacking, 40% physical Breaches ’15 ’16 ’17 Looking at all-industry data, most cyberattacks are opportunistic. But in manufacturing, 86% are targeted. That target is often the planning, research and development for your new solution. Almost half (47%) of breaches involved the theft of intellectual property to gain competitive advantage. In terms of data theft, web application attacks leveraging poor validation of inputs or stolen credentials came top. But it’s not just the theft of data you need to worry about. Denial of service attacks can have serious consequences, including preventing transactions being processed and slowing down your website and in-store systems. 5 It’s time to act. Compromise Most compromises took minutes, or less 87% 68% Two-thirds went undiscovered for months or more Only 3% are discovered as quickly Months Weeks < Before the compromise Days Hours Minutes Minutes Hours Days Elapsed time Weeks Months After the compromise > The time it takes cybercriminals to compromise a system is often just a matter of minutes—or even seconds. They don’t need much time to extract valuable data—they usually have much more than they need as it typically takes organizations weeks or months to discover a breach. 68% of breaches took months or longer to discover. at. In many cases, it’s not even the organization itself that spots the breach—it’s often a third party, like law enforcement or a partner. Worst of all, many breaches are spotted by customers. You don’t need us to tell you how bad that would be for your brand reputation. Protecting your good name comes down to two things: defense and response. You should build defenses that are strong enough to send cybercriminals in the direction of an easier target. But no defense is 100% effective. Should an attacker get through, you need to be prepared to respond quickly and effectively. What you can do Be vigilant Don’t wait to find out about a breach from law enforcement or a customer. Log files and change management systems can give you early warning of a security compromise. Make people your first line of defense Do your employees understand how important cybersecurity is to your brand, and your bottom line? Get them on board, and teach them how to spot the signs of an attack and how to react. Only keep data on a need-to-know basis Do you know who can see your sensitive data and systems? Limit access to the people who need it to do their jobs, and have processes in place to revoke it when they change roles. Patch promptly Cybercriminals are still successfully exploiting known vulnerabilities. You can guard against many threats simply by keeping your anti-virus software up to date. Encrypt sensitive data Do what you may, one day you’re likely to be the victim of a breach. But by encrypting your data you can render it useless if it is stolen. Use two-factor authentication Phishing campaigns are still hugely effective. And employees make mistakes. Two-factor authentication can limit the damage that can be done if credentials are lost or stolen. Don’t forget physical security Not all data theft happens online. Surveillance cameras and entry systems for restricted areas, for example, can help avoid criminals tampering with systems or stealing sensitive material. 6 Months Weeks Weeks Months Days Days Hours Hours Minutes Minutes Elapsed time Compromise Two-thirds went undiscovered for months or more Most compromises took minutes, or less 87% 68% Only 3% are discovered as quickly < Before the compromise After the compromise > 7 Leverage our intelligence. Attackers are constantly developing new tactics to help them access your systems and data. But what’s clear from our research is that too many organizations continue to make their job easy. Some companies are failing to take the most basic of security measures— like keeping anti-virus software up to date or training staff on how to spot the signs of an attack. The best way to mitigate the risks is to understand the threats you face. The DBIR can help. Back in 2014, we identified nine incident patterns that cover most of the threats you’re likely to face—and these still hold true today. 94% of security incidents and 90% of confirmed data breaches fall into our nine incident classification patterns across all years. These patterns give you a quick and easy way to assess the biggest risks to your business. That means if you’re commissioning a new app or updating systems, you can build more effective security in from the start. And it means that security professionals can prioritize their spend. For more information on the patterns and how they relate to your industry, take a look at the 2018 DBIR.

Identify and patch server vulnerabilities with availability impacts. Perform capacity planning testing to handle spikes in legitimate traffic. Build in redundancy and conduct failover testing. About the cover The arc diagram on the cover is based on the data in Appendix C: Beaten paths in the main report. It illustrates the actors, actions, and attributes as nodes; and the order of their occurrence in attack paths as edges. We’ve counted how many times each node occurs in each path and sized them accordingly—the larger the node, the more times it appeared. The edges between nodes are represented as arcs between points. The color of each arc is based on how often an attack proceeds between those two nodes. verizonenterprise.com © 2018 Ve r izon . A l l R igh ts Rese r ved .

      "The shakeup includes the formation of two new engineering teams that will prioritize Microsoft's cloud and artificial intelligence products — a move that should make investors happy, said Brad Reback, a software analyst at Stifel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: Next stop for Microsoft: $1 trillion?\n",
      "\n",
      "Morgan Stanley (MS) said recently that Microsoft (MSFT) could hit $1 trillion in market value within a year, thanks in large part to the strengths of Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing service, and the cloud-based Office 365 software suite.\n",

      "China is testing cutting-edge defence technology to develop a powerful yet relatively low-cost weather modification system to bring substantially more rain to the Tibetan plateau, Asia’s biggest freshwater reserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system, which involves an enormous network of fuel-burning chambers installed high up on the Tibetan mountains, could increase rainfall in the region by up to 10 billion cubic metres a year – about 7 per cent of China’s total water consumption – according to researchers involved in the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tens of thousands of chambers will be built at selected locations across the Tibetan plateau to produce rainfall over a total area of about 1.6 million square kilometres (620,000 square miles), or three times the size of Spain. It will be the world’s biggest such project.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chambers burn solid fuel to produce silver iodide, a cloud-seeding agent with a crystalline structure much like ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chambers stand on steep mountain ridges facing the moist monsoon from south Asia. As wind hits the mountain, it produces an upward draft and sweeps the particles into the clouds to induce rain and snow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“[So far,] more than 500 burners have been deployed on alpine slopes in Tibet, Xinjiang and other areas for experimental use. The data we have collected show very promising results,” a researcher working on the system told the South China Morning Post.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system is being developed by the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation – a major space and defence contractor that is also leading other ambitious national projects, including lunar exploration and the construction of China’s space station.\n",
      "\n",
      "China builds ‘world’s biggest air purifier’ (and it seems to be working)\n",
      "\n",
      "Space scientists designed and constructed the chambers using cutting-edge military rocket engine technology, enabling them to safely and efficiently burn the high-density solid fuel in the oxygen-scarce environment at an altitude of over 5,000 metres (16,400 feet), according to the researcher who declined to be named due to the project’s sensitivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the idea is not new – other countries like the United States have conducted similar tests on small sites – China is the first to attempt such a large-scale application of the technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chambers’ daily operation will be guided by highly precise real-time data collected from a network of 30 small weather satellites monitoring monsoon activities over the Indian Ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ground-based network will also employ other cloud-seeding methods using planes, drones and artillery to maximise the effect of the weather modification system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is Mekong River set to become the new South China Sea for regional disputes?\n",
      "\n",
      "The gigantic glaciers and enormous underground reservoirs found on the Tibetan plateau, which is often referred to as Asia’s water tower, render it the source of most of the continent’s biggest rivers – including the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween and Brahmaputra.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rivers, which flow through China, India, Nepal, Laos, Myanmar and several other countries, are a lifeline to almost half of the world’s population.\n",
      "\n",
      "But because of shortages across the continent, the Tibetan plateau is also seen as a potential flashpoint as Asian nations struggle to secure control over freshwater resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the large volume of water-rich air currents that pass over the plateau each day, the plateau is one of the driest places on Earth. Most areas receive less than 10cm of rain a year. An area that sees less than 25cm of rain annually is defined as a desert by the US Geological Survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rain is formed when moist air cools and collides with particles floating in the atmosphere, creating heavy water droplets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Resource-hungry China is in overdrive as it wages water wars by stealth\n",
      "\n",
      "The silver iodide produced by the burning chambers will provide the particles required to form rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radar data showed that a gentle breeze could carry the cloud-seeding particles more than 1,000 metres above the mountain peaks, according to the researcher.\n",
      "\n",
      "A single chamber can form a strip of thick clouds stretching across more than 5km.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes snow would start falling almost immediately after we ignited the chamber. It was like standing on the stage of a magic show,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The technology was initially developed as part of the Chinese military’s weather modification programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "China and other countries, including Russia and the United States, have been researching ways to trigger natural disasters such as floods, droughts and tornadoes to weaken their enemies in the event of severe conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts to employ the defence technology for civilian use began over a decade ago, the researcher said.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest challenges the rainmakers faced was finding a way to keep the chambers operating in one of the world’s most remote and hostile environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In our early trials, the flame often extinguished midway [because of the lack of oxygen in the area],” the researcher said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, after several improvements to the design, the chambers should be able to operate in a near-vacuum for months, or even years, without requiring maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "China diverts 10 billion cubic metres of water to arid north\n",
      "\n",
      "They also burn fuel as cleanly and efficiently as rocket engines, releasing only vapours and carbon dioxide, which makes them suitable for use even in environmentally protected areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Communications and other electronic equipment is powered by solar energy and the chambers can be operated by a smart phone app thousands of kilometres away for through the satellite forecasting system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chambers have one clear advantage over other cloud-seeding methods such as using planes, cannons and drones to blast silver iodide into the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Other methods requires the establishment of a no-fly zone. This can be time-consuming and troublesome in any country, especially China,” the researcher said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ground-based network also comes at a relatively low price – each burning unit costs about 50,000 yuan (US$8,000) to build and install. Costs are likely to drop further due to mass production.\n",
      "\n",
      "In comparison, a cloud-seeding plane costs several million yuan and covers a smaller area.\n",
      "\n",
      "One downside of the burning chambers, however, is that they will not work in the absence of wind or when the wind is blowing the wrong direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "This month, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation signed an agreement with Tsinghua University and Qinghai province to set up a large-scale weather modification system on the Tibetan plateau.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016 researchers from Tsinghua, China’s leading research university, first proposed a project – named Tianhe or Sky River – to increase the water supply in China’s arid northern regions by manipulating the climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project aims to intercept the water vapour carried by the Indian monsoon over the Tibetan plateau and redistribute it in the northern regions to increase the water supply there by five to 10 billion cubic metres a year.\n",

      "\n",
      "“[Modifying the weather in Tibet] is a critical innovation to solve China’s water shortage problem,” Lei said. “It will make an important contribution not only to China’s development and world prosperity, but also the well being of the entire human race.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tsinghua president Qiu Yong said the agreement signalled the central government’s determination to apply cutting-edge military technology in civilian sectors. The technology will significantly spur development in China’s western regions, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contents of the agreement are being kept confidential as it contains sensitive information that the authorities have deemed unsuitable to be revealed at the moment, a Tsinghua professor with knowledge of the deal told the Post.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate simulations show that the Tibetan plateau is likely to experience a severe drought over the coming decades as natural rainfall fails to replenish the water lost as a result of rising temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The satellite network and weather modification measures are to make preparations for the worst-case scenario,” the Tsinghua researcher said.\n",

The first dataset is the historical NDFD / NDGD data distributed by NCEP / NOAA / NWS. The NDFD (National Digital Forecast Database) and NDGD (National Digital Guidance Database) contain gridded forecasts and observations at 2.5km resolution for the Contiguous United States (CONUS). There are also 5km grids for several smaller US regions and non-continguous territories, such as Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico and Alaska. NOAA distributes archives of the NDFD/NDGD via its NOAA Operational Model Archive and Distribution System (NOMADS) in Grib2 format.

      "The popular media is full of examples of bad leaders in government, academia, and business. But the most common kind of incompetent leader isn’t the ranting, narcissistic sociopath that might immediately come to mind. Rather, it’s the “absentee leader” — those in leadership roles who are psychologically absent from them. These people were promoted into management, and enjoy the privileges and rewards of a leadership role, but avoid meaningful involvement with their teams. Absentee leaders kill engagement and productivity. Research shows that being ignored by one’s boss is more alienating than being treated poorly, and that the impact of absentee leadership on job satisfaction outlasts the impact of both constructive and more overtly destructive forms of leadership. The chances are good, however, that your organization is unaware of its absentee leaders, because they specialize in flying under the radar by not doing anything that attracts attention. Nonetheless, the adhesiveness of their negative impact may be slowly and silently killing your organization.\n",

My friend was giving it his all, but he needed more support and better feedback than he received. He wanted a leader who would be around when he needed them, and who would give him substantive advice, not platitudes. As a measure of his frustration, he said, “I would rather have had a boss who yelled at me or made unrealistic demands than this one, who provided empty praise.”\n",

      "Researchers have studied managerial derailment — or the dark side of leadership — for many years. The key derailment characteristics of bad managers are well documented and fall into three broad behavioral categories: (1) “moving away behaviors,” which create distance from others through hyper-emotionality, diminished communication, and skepticism that erodes trust; (2) “moving against behaviors,” which overpower and manipulate people while aggrandizing the self; and (3) “moving toward behaviors,” which include being ingratiating, overly conforming, and reluctant to take chances or stand up for one’s team. The popular media is full of examples of bad leaders in government, academia, and business with these characteristics. However, my friend was describing something arguably worse than an incompetent boss. His manager was not overtly misbehaving, nor was he a ranting, narcissistic sociopath. Rather, his boss was a leader in title only — his role was leadership, but he provided none. My friend was experiencing absentee leadership, and unfortunately, he is not alone. Absentee leadership rarely comes up in today’s leadership or business literature, but research shows that it is the most common form of incompetent leadership.\n",

The impact of absentee leadership on job satisfaction outlasts the impact of both constructive and overtly destructive forms of leadership. Constructive leadership immediately improves job satisfaction, but the effects dwindle quickly. Destructive leadership immediately degrades job satisfaction, but the effects dissipate after about six months. In contrast, the impact of absentee leadership takes longer to appear, but it degrades subordinates’ job satisfaction for at least two years. It also is related to a number of other negative outcomes for employees, like role ambiguity, health complaints, and increased bullying from team members. Absentee leadership creates employee stress, which can lead to poor employee health outcomes and talent drain, which then impact an organization’s bottom line.\n",
      "\n",
      "If absentee leadership is so destructive, why don’t we read more about it in the business literature? Consider a story I recently heard about the dean of a well-known law school: Two senior, well-regarded faculty members called the provost to complain about their dean because, they said, he wouldn’t do anything. The provost responded by saying that he had a dean who was a drunk, a dean who was accused of sexual harassment, and a dean who was accused of misusing funds, but the law school dean never caused him any problems. So, the provost said, the faculty members would just have to deal with their dean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the provost in this example, many organizations don’t confront absentee leaders because they have other managers whose behavior is more overtly destructive. Because absentee leaders don’t actively make trouble, their negative impact on organizations can be difficult to detect, and when it is detected, it often is considered a low-priority problem. Thus, absentee leaders are often silent organization killers. Left unchecked, absentee leaders clog an organization’s succession arteries, blocking potentially more effective people from moving into important roles while adding little to productivity. Absentee leaders rarely engage in unforgivable bouts of bad behavior, and are rarely the subject of ethics investigations resulting from employee hotline calls. As a result, their negative effect on organizations accumulates over time, largely unchecked.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your organization is one of the relatively few with effective selection and promotion methods in place, then it may be able to identify effective and destructive leaders. Even if your organization isn’t great at talent identification, both types of leaders are easy to spot once they are on the job. They also produce predictable organizational outcomes: Constructive leadership creates high engagement and productivity, while destructive leadership kills engagement and productivity. The chances are good, however, that your organization is unaware of its absentee leaders, because they specialize in flying under the radar by not doing anything that attracts attention. Nonetheless, the adhesiveness of their negative impact may be slowly harming the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "The war for leadership talent is real, and organizations with the best leaders will win. Reviewing your organization’s management positions for absentee leaders and doing something about them can improve your talent management arsenal. It’s likely that your competitors are overlooking this issue or choosing not to do anything about it, like the university provost. Doing nothing about absentee leaders is easy. Just ask any absentee leader.\n",

      "The Defense Department’s research wing is serious about putting drones into action, not just one by one but in coordinated swarms. The Offensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics program is kicking off its second “sprint,” a period of solicitation and rapid prototyping of systems based around a central theme. This spring sprint is all about “autonomy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea is to collect lots of ideas on how new technology, be it sensors, software, or better propeller blades, can enhance the ability of drones to coordinate and operate as a collective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, swarms of 50 will need to “isolate an urban objective” within half an hour or so by working together with each other and ground-based robot. That at least is the “operational backdrop” that should guide prospective entrants in their decision whether their tech is applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "So a swarm of drones that seed a field faster than a tractor, while practical for farmers, isn’t really something the Pentagon is interested in here. On the other hand, if you can sell that idea as a swarm of drones dropping autonomous sensors on an urban battlefield, they might take a shine to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you could also simply demonstrate how using a compact ground-based lidar system could improve swarm coordination at low cost and without using visible light. Or maybe you’ve designed a midair charging system that lets a swarm perk up flagging units without human intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those are pretty good ideas, actually — maybe I’ll run them by the program manager, Timothy Chung, when he’s on stage at our Robotics event in Berkeley this May. Chung also oversees the Subterranean Challenge and plenty more at DARPA. He looks like he’s having a good time in the video explaining the ground rules of this new sprint:\n",
      "\n",
      "You don’t have to actually have 50 drones to take part — there are simulators and other ways of demonstrating value. More information on the program and how to submit your work for consideration can be found at the FBO page.\n",

      "If your company uses Slack for group communication, you might want to watch what you say in Direct Messages with your colleagues: the app now lets administrators export all the data shared through it, including those private conversations – without notifying you.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s thanks to an updated privacy policy and tools that help Slack comply with GDPR rules; they grant customers on Slack’s Plus and Enterprise Grid plans access to a self-service tool for exporting data from all public and private channels. This functionality was previously available too, but it used to notify users when it was turned on, so they’d know that their DMs weren’t entirely private.\n",

      "\n",
      "But don’t assume that you’re safe if your organization uses a free or Standard plan; administrators can request access to the data export tool by providing Slack with either valid legal process, consent of team members, or a requirement or right under applicable laws. Alternatively, they can use whitelisted apps that do the same thing; you can look up the apps connected to your team’s Slack by visiting https://YourTeamNameHere.slack.com/apps/manage, but it could take a while to figure out if any of those are designed to export data from private channels.\n",

      "Microsoft Rushes Out Fix for Major Hole Caused by Previous Meltdown Patch\n",
      "\n",
      "Issue affects Windows 7 x64 and Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft has rushed out an out-of-cycle security patch to address problems created by what were supposed to be fixes for the Meltdown vulnerability that it had previously issued for 64-bit Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an advisory Thursday, the company urged anyone running Windows 7 for x64 systems or Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based systems to immediately install the new update. The advice applies to all organizations and users that have installed any of Microsoft's security updates during or after January 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "The update for CVE-2018-1038 stems from a warning by Swedish penetration tester Ulf Frisk that Microsoft's Meltdown patch for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 created a bigger hole than the one the patch was designed to fix.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patch basically allowed any running process on these systems to read the complete contents in memory and to write to it as well. \"Exploitation was just a matter of read and write to already mapped in-process virtual memory,\" Frisk said. \"No fancy APIs or syscalls required — just standard read and write.\" The problem stemmed from a permission bit in a key memory table being set in \"user\" mode rather than \"supervisor\" mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This made the page tables available to user-mode code in every process,\" rather than only by the kernel itself, Frisk said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chris Goetti, director of product management at Ivanti, says the vulnerability created by the Microsoft patch is pretty significant and something that needs to be addressed with haste, if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When Microsoft issued a fix for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008, they made a mistake and ended up opening up read and write access in RAM so anybody could access anything in memory and write to it,\" he says. \"It is a significant vulnerability and leaves those systems pretty much exposed\" without the update.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, those with affected systems should test the new patch quickly and roll it out. Another option for those that don't have the time to test the new patch will be to roll back the March update and wait for Microsoft's April update, which is due April 11.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are close to the April update,\" Goetti says. \"Our guidance is to either apply the new update or roll back the March update,\" for Windows 7 x64-bit systems and Windows Server 2008 x64-bit systems, he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Organizations should not make the mistake of assuming the issue is related to Meltdown/Spectre and wait for things to settle down, cautions Jack Danahy, CTO and co-founder of Barkly. \"This is an easy-to-exploit zero-day vulnerability and a much more probable attack vector that the original problem that Microsoft was trying to correct.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike problems created by Spectre and Meltdown, \"this isn't just a cleanup exercise. Microsoft accidentally distributed a new zero-day vulnerability of their own design.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The error is an example of the kind of issues that can crop up when things are rushed, he says. Fixing bugs is akin to serious software development, and it creates the same opportunities for mistakes, Danahy notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think that this will only serve to further deteriorate organizational willingness to apply patches automatically and without their own testing,\" he says. \"I'm personally hoping that everyone deploys this patch to CVE-2018-1038, because this vulnerability is so easy to exploit that there are already exploit toolkits integrating it.\"\n",

      "Tracking your fitness goals is good for you. It can be worrying, though, if the information from your fitness tracker is exposed to criminals. That's the state some fitness buffs find themselves in after a breach of 150 million user accounts from the MyFitnessPal app from Under Armour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company has said that they have seen no evidence that any accounts have been logged into by an unauthorized user or that any illicit login attempts have been made. In an email to those affected they suggest that all MyFitnessPal users immediately change their passwords, a step that will ultimately be required for all users.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a statement from the company, on Feb. 25 Under Armour became aware that someone had gained access to the file in February, with the ability to see usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords for the users. Under Armour stated that no Social Security numbers were seen because they don't collect them, and no credit card numbers were stolen because that information is stored in a different system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Armour says that they do not know the hacker's identity, though they are continuing to work with law enforcement agencies on the investigation.\n",

      "Article:\n",
      "In November 2016, around seven hours after Abdul Razak Ali Artan had mowed down a group of people in his car, gone on a stabbing spree with a butcher's knife and been shot dead by a police officer on the grounds of Ohio State University, an FBI agent applied the bloodied body's index finger to the iPhone found on the deceased. The cops hoped it would help them access the Apple device to learn more about the assailant's motives and Artan himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is according to FBI forensics specialist Bob Moledor, who detailed for Forbes the first known case of police using a deceased person's fingerprints in an attempt to get past the protections of Apple's Touch ID technology. Unfortunately for the FBI, Artan's lifeless fingerprint didn't unlock the device (an iPhone 5 model, though Moledor couldn't recall which. Touch ID was introduced in the iPhone 5S). In the hours between his death and the attempt to unlock, when the feds had to go through legal processes regarding access to the smartphone, the iPhone had gone to sleep and when reopened required a passcode, Moledor said. He sent the device to a forensics lab which managed to retrieve information from the iPhone, the FBI phone expert and a Columbus officer who worked the case confirmed. That data helped the authorities determine that Artan's failed attempt to murder innocents may have been a result of ISIS-inspired radicalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where Moledor's attempt failed, others have succeeded. Separate sources close to local and federal police investigations in New York and Ohio, who asked to remain anonymous as they weren't authorized to speak on record, said it was now relatively common for fingerprints of the deceased to be depressed on the scanner of Apple iPhones, devices which have been wrapped up in increasingly powerful encryption over recent years. For instance, the technique has been used in overdose cases, said one source. In such instances, the victim's phone could contain information leading directly to the dealer.\n",
      "\n",
      "No privacy for the dead\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's entirely legal for police to use the technique, even if there might be some ethical quandaries to consider. Marina Medvin, owner of Medvin Law, said that once a person is deceased, they no longer have a privacy interest in their dead body. That means they no longer have standing in court to assert privacy rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relatives or other interested parties have little chance of stopping cops using fingerprints or other body parts to access smartphones too. \"Once you share information with someone, you lose control over how that information is protected and used. You cannot assert your privacy rights when your friend's phone is searched and the police see the messages that you sent to your friend. Same goes for sharing information with the deceased - after you released information to the deceased, you have lost control of privacy,\" Medvin added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police know it too. \"We do not need a search warrant to get into a victim's phone, unless it's shared owned,\" said Ohio police homicide detective Robert Cutshall, who worked on the Artan case. In previous cases detailed by Forbes police have required warrants to use the fingerprints of the living on their iPhones.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are some anxieties around the ability of the police to turn up at a crime scene and immediately start accessing deceased individuals' cellphones without any need for permission. Greg Nojeim, senior counsel and director of the Freedom, Security and Technology Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology, said it's possible in many cases there would be a valid concern about law enforcement using fingerprints on smartphones without any probable cause. \"That's why the idea of requiring a warrant isn't out of bounds,\" Nojeim added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside the lack of legal restrictions, the fingerprint method's much cheaper than having to pay a contractor like Cellebrite or U.S. startup GrayShift (whose iPhone hacking tech was revealed by Forbes earlier this month) to unlock a phone. Whilst Cellebrite is believed to charge between $1,500 and $3,000 for each iPhone, GrayShift's GrayKey hacking box costs up to $30,000 for unlimited unlock attempts. Once the phone's opened, the cops will keep it in that state and send the device to forensics experts. They'll then use tools like Cellebrite's UFED tech to draw all the information out for investigators to explore. More often than not, police will already have those forensics services on hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Face ID hacks\n",
      "\n",
      "Police are now looking at how they might use Apple's Face ID facial recognition technology, introduced on the iPhone X. And it could provide an easier path into iPhones than Touch ID.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marc Rogers, researcher and head of information security at Cloudflare, told Forbes he'd been poking at Face ID in recent months and had discovered it didn't appear to require the visage of a living person to work. Whilst Face ID is supposed to use your attention in combination with natural eye movement, so fake or non-moving eyes can't unlock devices, Rogers found that the tech can be fooled simply using photos of open eyes. That was something also verified by Vietnamese researchers when they claimed to have bypassed Face ID with specially-created masks in November 2017, said Rogers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, Rogers discovered this was possible from many angles and the phone only seemed to need to see one open eye to unlock. \"In that sense it's easier to unlock than Touch ID - all you need to do is show your target his or her phone and the moment they glance it unlocks,\" he added. Apple declined to comment for this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, for the average user who's in control of their phone, there isn't much to worry about here. And there's no evidence police have opened victims' iPhones via Face ID. So far. \"I don't know that's been used yet,\" said Moledor. \"It's probably going to be same as using the fingerprint. As long as the subject is recognisable, it should work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't be surprised if cops do start holding iPhone X devices up to the faces of the dead in the near future then, if it hasn't happened already. As Cutshall said: \"I've not be told there's a legal issue to use people's fingerprints or facial recognition to get into a phone... [if it's part of a legal process] that'd be something we would do.\"\n",

      "The authors examined the relationship of alcohol outlet density (AOD) and neighborhood poverty with binge drinking and alcohol-related problems among drinkers in married and cohabitating relationships and assessed whether these associations differed across sex. A U.S. national population couples survey was linked to U.S. Census data on AOD and neighborhood poverty. The 1,784 current drinkers in the survey reported on their binge drinking, alcohol-related problems, and other covariates. AOD was defined as the number of alcohol outlets per 10,000 persons and was obtained at the zip code level. Neighborhood poverty was as having a low (<20%) or high (≥20%) proportion of residents living in poverty at the census tract level. We used logistic regression for survey data to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals and tested for differences of associations by sex. Associations of neighborhood poverty with binge drinking were stronger for male than for female drinkers. The association of neighborhood poverty with alcohol-related problems was also stronger for men than for women. We observed no relationships between AOD and binge drinking or alcohol-related problems in this couples survey. Efforts to reduce binge drinking or alcohol-related problems among partners in committed relationships may have the greatest impact if targeted to male drinkers living in high-poverty neighborhoods. Binge drinking and alcohol-related problems, as well as residence in an impoverished neighborhood are risk factors for intimate partner violence (IPV) and other relationship conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "We used a national population-based survey of couples with detailed individual-level alcohol information and neighborhood information on alcohol availability and poverty to address our questions of interest. (a) Is alcohol availability and neighborhood poverty associated with binge drinking and alcohol-related problems among drinkers in committed relationships? (b) Do these associations vary by sex? We hypothesized that a high AOD and neighborhood impoverishment would be positively associated with binge drinking and alcohol-related problems and that sex would modify the associations between neighborhood characteristics and drinking outcomes. Our analysis of sex differences was less prescribed due to the limited research in this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alcohol availability and neighborhood impoverishment may influence drinking patterns and alcohol-related violence differently for men and women. Both Cunradi (2010) and Karriker-Jaffe (2011) have called for further research on gender differences in the effects of neighborhood disadvantage and AOD on alcohol consumption and IPV. Some studies show a stronger association between neighborhood disadvantage and alcohol and mental health outcomes for men as compared with women ( Karvonen & Rimpelä, 1997 ; Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2003 ; Simons, Johnson, Beaman, Conger, & Whitbeck, 1996 ), although the evidence for this link remains tentative. For this study, we reasoned that men of lower socioeconomic status who tend to live in impoverished neighborhoods (which tend to have a higher AOD), may binge drink more frequently than their male counterparts in more affluent neighborhoods ( National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2006 ). Greater frequency of binge drinking among these men may be related to increased alcohol availability, cultural, social, or stress-related reasons. In contrast, women of lower socioeconomic status who tend to live in impoverished areas may binge drink less than their more affluent female counterparts due to more conservative cultural or social norms or greater caregiver responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher rates of alcohol-related violence in areas with high AOD and in impoverished neighborhoods may be related to the characteristics and drinking patterns of residents. For example, impoverished neighborhoods are disproportionately composed of individuals with relatively low levels of education and income and, though these individuals tend to have a lower average volume of alcohol intake, they may binge drink with greater frequency than their better educated and wealthier counterparts ( National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2006 ). Although studies have examined the relationship of AOD and neighborhood poverty to measures of alcohol intake such as average volume, heavy drinking, or frequency of drinking, we know of none that has evaluated binge drinking (typically defined as ≥5 or ≥4 drinks per occasion for males and females). Binge drinking may lead to acute intoxication, impaired decision making or increased aggressive behavior ( Peterson, Rothfleisch, Zelazo, & Pihl, 1990 ; Sayette, Wilson, & Elias, 1993 ). Caetano, Schafer, and Cunradi (2001) reported higher rates of male-to-female partner violence for males who are frequent binge drinkers, that is, consuming five or more drinks on occasion at least once a week. General population surveys correlate binge drinking with both being in a fight and being the target of aggression while drinking ( Rehm et al., 2003 ). This type of drinking may be the pattern of drinking most likely to elevate the risk of violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "One explanation for the link between AOD and alcohol-related harms, including IPV, is that the greater physical availability of alcohol increases individual-level alcohol consumption thereby elevating the risk of experiencing such harms ( Speer, Gorman, Labouvie, & Ontkush, 1998 ). Heavy drinkers may also cluster in neighborhoods with higher alcohol availability ( Scribner, Cohen, & Fisher, 2000 ). For impoverished neighborhoods, resident alcohol consumption may be linked to several factors, including increased psychological distress, diminished social ties and shared norms between neighbors, and the availability of fewer institutional resources to address residents’ needs ( Hill & Angel, 2005 ; Sampson, Morenoff, & Gannon-Rowley, 2002 ). Although relationships between AOD or neighborhood poverty and increased risk for partner violence have been identified (as well as between alcohol consumption and IPV), the link between these neighborhood characteristics and drinking outcomes in couples is less clear. In this study, we sought to test the relationships for AOD and neighborhood poverty to alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems for drinkers in married or cohabiting relationships. This is a preliminary study to examine drinking and related problems in couples as a putative mechanism linking neighborhood characteristics to IPV. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test these relationships using couples data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because studies have reported that impoverished neighborhoods tend to have high AOD and both of these factors may be associated with alcohol intake, in our adjusted analyses we accounted for neighborhood poverty when examining the relation between AOD and binge drinking or alcohol-related problems and accounted for AOD when examining the relation between neighborhood poverty and binge drinking or alcohol-related problems. To isolate the relationship between AOD and binge drinking (a specific type of drinking), we adjusted for the average number of alcoholic drinks per week consumed. Since we anticipated a high AOD may lead to greater number of drinks per week and a high frequency of binge drinking, both of which could increase the risk of alcohol-related problems, we did not adjust for number of drinks per week in our adjusted analyses of alcohol-related problems. For associations related to neighborhood poverty, we did not control for other neighborhood census level socioeconomic factors since many were strong correlates of neighborhood poverty (e.g., percentage unemployed).\n",
      "\n",
      "In each model, we initially adjusted for all sociodemographic factors and certain behavioral factors listed and as categorized in , including illicit drug use, IPV, and child physical abuse identified a priori as potential confounders. Those potential confounders found not to change estimates to a meaningful degree when removed from our initial models, generally by less than 10%, were dropped from the models ( Maldonado & Greenland, 1993 ; Rothman, 2002 ). Adjustment variables for each model are noted in .\n",
      "\n",
      "We calculated descriptive statistics for individual and neighborhood characteristics across categories of binge drinking and alcohol-related problems. We estimated unadjusted and adjusted associations for AOD or neighborhood poverty with binge drinking or alcohol-related problems. We used standard logistic regression models for survey data to estimate odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of associations for alcohol-related problems; similar multinomial logistic regression methods were used to estimate associations related to our three-category measure of binge drinking. To evaluate the moderating effect of male and female sex on the associations between AOD or neighborhood poverty and binge drinking or alcohol-related problems, we fit logistic regression models with the multiplicative interaction terms for sex and AOD and sex and neighborhood poverty. We used a survey-based Wald test to derive a p value for the interaction terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "All statistical analyses used the survey sampling adjustment implemented in Stata 10.0 and were weighted to account for the complex sampling design. More specifically, because our adjustment for clustering at the primary sampling unit level also accounts for clustering below this level, no further adjustment for clustering in zip codes, census tracts, or couples was necessary ( Binder, 1983 ; Williams, 2000 ). We specified the subpopulation of interest (i.e., drinkers) in our analysis to ensure appropriate estimation of standard errors ( Cochran, 1977 ; Rao, 2003 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "These sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics for survey respondents represent potential confounders in assessing the relationships between neighborhood characteristics (i.e., AOD and neighborhood poverty) and drinking outcomes (i.e., binge drinking and alcohol-related problems). We defined potential confounders as factors plausibly related to both AOD or neighborhood poverty and binge drinking or alcohol-related problems but not in the causal pathway ( Koepsell & Weiss, 2003 ) based on our knowledge of the literature and the relationships between factors. For example, an individual’s income was believed plausibly associated with neighborhood poverty and frequency of binge drinking and, therefore, included as a potential confounder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Survey participants who reported any use of cocaine, heroin, or marijuana in the 12 months prior to the survey were categorized as having a history of illicit drug use; otherwise participants were considered not to have used illicit drugs. To assess IPV, respondents were asked about a series of physically violent behaviors from the Conflict Tactics Scale, Form R, a validated and commonly used scale for assessing IPV ( Straus, 1990 ). These violent behaviors included threw something; pushed, grabbed, or shoved; slapped; kicked, bit, or hit; hit or tried to hit with something; beat up; choked; burned or scalded; forced to have sex; threatened with a knife or gun; and had knife or gun used against you/partner. Each respondent reported separately their behavior toward their partner and their partner’s behavior toward them. IPV was positive for a respondent if they or their partner reported that either partner had committed any of the specified violent behaviors in the past year; otherwise respondents were categorized as not having experienced IPV. Respondents who reported a parent or caregiver had ever hit them with something; beaten them up; burned or scalded them; threatened them with a knife or gun; or used a knife or gun against them during childhood were categorized as having a history of childhood physical abuse, otherwise respondents were categorized as not having experienced childhood physical abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ethnicity was self-reported and categorized as follows: those reporting Hispanic ethnicity were classified as Hispanic. The remaining respondents were classified as either non-Hispanic Black (“Black”), non-Hispanic White (“White”), or non-Hispanic Other (“Other”). Total household income was collected from one respondent in each couple to include all sources of income in the household; both respondents in each couple have the same household income. We categorized total household income into (a) <US$10,000, (b) US$10,000 to US$19,999, (c) US$20,000 to US$29,999, (d) US$30,000 to US$39,999, and (e) ≥US$40,000. Other characteristics considered included sex (male and female), age (18–29, 30–39, 40–49, and ≥50 years old), educational attainment (<high school, high school degree or equivalent, and >high school) and employment status (4 categories; employed, unemployed, retired, and homemaker/other).\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants who responded affirmatively to having experienced ≥1 of 25 alcohol-related social or dependence problems in the past year were classified as having an alcohol-related problem ( Cunradi et al., 1999 ); otherwise respondents were classified as not having an alcohol-related problem. Each of the 25 questions specifically implicated alcohol as being a contributing factor to the social or dependence problem. Social consequences covered problems with police, accidents, health-related problems, work-related problems, relationship problems, arguments or fights, and financial problems. Alcohol dependence symptoms were associated with a physical addiction to alcohol, including withdrawal, tolerance, and impaired control. Other alcohol-related symptoms, experiences, and feelings were assessed (e.g., in the last year: “I have often taken a drink the first thing when I wake up in the morning”; “My drinking interfered with my spare time activities or hobbies”; and “Sometimes I needed a drink so badly that I couldn’t think of anything else”). We combined alcohol-related dependence and social problems into one measure because in this general population sample of couples alcohol-related problems were relatively rare and because this was an initial assessment of the hypothesis that sex modifies the association of AOD or neighborhood poverty and alcohol-related problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Binge drinking was defined as consuming ≥5 drinks in a single day. To measure binge drinking, we asked respondents how frequently they consumed 5 to 7, 8 to 11, and 12 or more drinks of any kind of alcoholic beverage in a single day during the last 12 months (nine categories that ranged from every day or nearly every day to one time/past year to never). Responses were converted into an average monthly binge drinking frequency, and we classified individuals into three groups: (a) those who did not binge drink, (b) those who binge drank, on average, >0–3, and (c) ≥4 times per month in the past year. Because we hypothesized that those who binge drink most frequently would be mostly influenced by alcohol availability, we selected a three-level category of binge drinking to assess associations related to frequent binge drinking rather than the more commonly used dichotomous measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weekly drinking volume combined two self-reported drinking variables (i.e., frequency and quantity). Respondents were asked (a) how frequently they usually drank wine, beer, or liquor (11 categories that ranged from ≥3 times/day to <1 time/year to never) and (b) what proportion of drinking occasions (five categories that ranged from nearly every time to never) they drank 1 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 to 6 glasses of each beverage type. On the basis of these reports, we estimated the average number of drinks per week consumed by respondents in the past 12 months. One drink was the equivalent to 12 g of absolute alcohol or a 4-oz glass of wine, 1-oz shot of distilled spirit, or 12-oz can or bottle of beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "We used the 1990 U.S. Census measure of the percentage of residents living in poverty to assess neighborhood impoverishment at the census tract level. This measure is robust and valid, similar to multifactor composite measures for detecting socioeconomic gradients across health conditions ( Krieger et al., 2002 , 2003a , 2003b ). We dichotomized the percentage living in poverty according to the U.S. Census definition of high-poverty areas ( U.S. Census Bureau, 1995 ). Residents of areas with <20% living in poverty were classified as living in an “affluent” area whereas residents of areas with ≥20% living in poverty were classified as living in an “impoverished” area. The poverty level for individuals and families used by the U.S. Census are based on pretax income and are updated every year to reflect the Consumer Price Index. In 1990, average poverty thresholds varied from US$6,652 for a person living alone to US$26,848 for a family of nine or more members ( U.S. Census Bureau, 1991 ). Because census tracts may cross over zip code boundaries, census tracts were spatially assigned to corresponding zip codes in which the majority of the census tract was physically located.\n",
      "\n",
      "North American Industry Classification System (NAICS; U.S. Census Bureau, 2001 ) codes were used to identify the number and types of alcohol outlets by zip code. We obtained NAICS code data from the 1997 Economic Census. The Economic Census is conducted every 5 years, in years ending in “2” and “7”; we selected 1997 data to best replicate the accrual period for the couples survey data. We incorporated state-level retail licensing law information because alcohol sales at some types of vendors such as drug or grocery stores (denoted in the NAICS codes) vary depending on state and local laws ( Distilled Spirits Council of the United States [DISCUS], 1996 ). We obtained state-level retail licensing law information from DISCUS (1996) to determine which states allowed alcohol sales for various business types (e.g., drug stores or grocery stores). Counts of these business types were included in aggregate counts for zip codes in states that allowed alcohol sales in these types of venues. We further classified alcohol outlet types into off- and on-premise AOD. Off-premise outlets, such as convenience stores, sell alcohol for consumption elsewhere; on-premise outlets include bars and restaurants where alcohol is consumed on-site. Our estimates of alcohol outlets were generally consistent with those in the Adams Liquor Handbook, a comprehensive alcohol sourcebook ( Adams Business Media, 1999 ). We calculated off-premise, on-premise, and total AOD as the number of outlets per 10,000 persons (based on 1990 U.S. Census population estimates). Because some establishments sold alcohol both off- and on-premise, measures add to more than the total in some zip codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This study is based on the 1,784 survey participants classified as current drinkers (weighted count; n = 1,949). Current drinkers consumed ≥1 alcoholic drink in the 12 months before the survey. Because our question of interest was related to a specific type of drinking (i.e., binge drinking) and having an alcohol-related problem, and since only current drinkers could report binge drinking or having an alcohol-related problem, the 1,407 nondrinkers were excluded; 39 individuals were excluded because of missing data. Our study examined AOD at the zip code level (n = 497), the smallest geographic area for which alcohol outlet data were available ( U.S. Department of Commerce Economics and Statistics Administration, 1997 ). Neighborhood impoverishment was from the 1990 U.S. Census at the tract level (n = 513; GeoLytics, 1998 ). We used census tract boundaries from the 1990 instead of the 2000 Census because they provided a closer alignment to the sampling units used for this couples’ survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individual-level data come from a national U.S. survey of couples using a multistage random probability sample of individuals 18 years of age or older from the 48 contiguous states in 1995 ( Cunradi, Caetano, Clark, & Schafer, 1999 ). In the original survey, 100 primary sampling units composed of standard statistical metropolitan areas, counties, or groups of counties were selected. Within each primary sampling unit, 15 secondary sampling units made up of combinations of census blocks were selected. Enumerators then listed all housing units in the secondary sampling units, and housing units were selected at random. For each selected house with one adult ≥18 years of age, an adult was selected at random and interviewed. When this person was married or live with someone in a romantic relationship for greater than 6 months, the partner was then also interviewed. In the end, 1,925 married or cohabitating participants were eligible, and 1,615 respondents and their partners (3,230 individuals) across 37 states and 588 zip codes completed a private face-to-face structured interview in English or Spanish. The overall response rate was 85%.\n",

      "Associations of total AOD were similar to estimates of off- and on-premise AOD (data not shown). In post hoc unadjusted analysis of a binary measure of AOD, residents of high AOD areas (≥5 per 10,000 residents) compared with residents of low AOD areas (<5 per 10,000 residents) had decreased odds of binge drinking >0–3 times per month, OR = 0.7, 95% CI [0.5, 1.1], and increased odds of binge drinking ≥4 times per month, OR = 2.2, 95% CI [1.0, 4.6], compared with nonbinge drinkers (overall p value for binge drinking = .01). In adjusted analysis of the binary measure of AOD, we observed similar point estimates, residents of high AOD areas versus residents of low AOD areas were 0.8 times as likely to binge drink >0–3 times per month, 95% CI [0.5, 1.2], but were 1.5 times as likely to binge drink ≥4 times per month, 95% CI [0.6, 3.5], compared with nonbinge drinkers (overall p value for binge drinking = .36). However, the wide confidence intervals which include 1.0 (no association) in the adjusted analysis preclude us from being able to make any conclusions concerning these findings.

In contrast, women living in impoverished neighborhoods were at inverse adjusted odds of binge drinking relative to their female counterparts in more affluent neighborhoods, though CIs were compatible with a wide range of estimates including no association. Similar findings were observed for the relationship between neighborhood poverty and alcohol-related problems; the adjusted and unadjusted associations differed for men and women (p values for multiplicative interaction ≤ .01). Men living in impoverished neighborhoods were more apt to have alcohol-related problems than their male counterparts in more affluent neighborhoods whereas women in impoverished areas were less apt to have alcohol-related problems relative to their female counterparts living in more affluent neighborhoods, though estimates among women had confidence intervals compatible with no association.\n",

Similar results were evident in our adjusted analysis. The association between AOD and binge drinking in adjusted analyses did not differ for men and women (p value for multiplicative interaction = .21). Similar to binge drinking, AOD appeared unassociated with alcohol-related problems in unadjusted or adjusted analysis and did not vary across sex (p value for multiplicative interaction = .29).

More striking differences were observed for neighborhood poverty. Nearly one quarter of those who binge drank ≥4 times per month lived in areas with ≥20% of residents living in poverty compared with <10% of nonbinge drinkers. As expected, nonbinge drinkers had a lower average weekly number of drinks than those who binge drank ≥4 times per month. More women than men abstained from binge drinking and five times more men than women binge drank ≥4 times per month. Relative to nonbinge drinkers, binge drinkers of ≥4 times per month were disproportionately Black or Hispanic; had less than a high school degree; were unemployed; had an annual household income <US$20,000; or reported illicit drug use, IPV, or child abuse. Comparable trends were observed for those with and without alcohol-related problems ( ). All variables had <2% missing data except household income which had 5.5%.\n",

      "Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "We examined one mechanism linking neighborhood conditions and the occurrence of IPV in couples, hypothesizing that neighborhood poverty and greater alcohol outlet density would increase binge drinking and alcohol-related problems for drinkers in couples. We found no association between AOD and binge drinking or alcohol-related problems. However, neighborhood poverty was positively associated with both binge drinking and alcohol-related problems among male partners who drink. Neighborhood poverty was inversely associated with binge drinking and alcohol-related problems among female partners who drink, though confidence intervals were compatible with a wide range of estimates including the possibility of no association. This is the first study to examine and find that the association between neighborhood poverty and the drinking outcomes of binge drinking and alcohol-related problems may differ for men and women drinkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neighborhood poverty was positively associated with binge drinking and alcohol-related problems among male drinkers and is consistent with alcohol-related violence like physical assaults that tend to be concentrated among men (U.S. Department of Justice, 2008). In couples, male binge drinking and alcohol-related problems are associated with increased rates for male perpetrated partner violence (Caetano et al., 2001). Male drinkers living in impoverished neighborhoods may binge drink more often than men in more affluent areas as a palliative escape from a stressful living environment. For example, Jones-Webb et al. (1997) reported that impoverished neighborhoods, associated with more alcohol-related problems for Black men, were characterized by low family incomes, more unemployment, and high population densities. Alternatively, it could be that a low level of collective efficacy (Sampson, Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997) inhibits residents’ ability to constrain this type of high-risk drinking. Other factors such as the types and characteristics of drinking places (e.g., cheap drinks in bars that offer minimal food vs. restaurants with more expensive drinks) may differ in wealthy and impoverished neighborhoods and may also influence binge drinking (LaVeist & Wallace, 2000). These same neighborhood characteristics may similarly increase male drinker’s risk of alcohol-related social or dependence problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, women living in impoverished neighborhoods may have different caretaking responsibilities and may ascribe to cultural norms that make the frequency of binge drinking lower than that found among female counterparts in wealthier areas. For example, compared with nonpoverty areas, poverty areas have a higher prevalence of larger families (1 in 25 vs. 1 in 75) and families not maintained by a married couple (35% vs. 17%; U.S. Census Bureau, 1995); both family types may be more likely to have increased caretaking responsibilities for females. Other norms and attitudes governing alcohol use as well as coping mechanisms for stress-related poverty may also differ for men and women. There is greater stigma associated with drinking for women than men (Herd, 1997). Greenfield and Room (Greenfield & Room, 1997) reported that women compared with men are less accepting of drinking and drunkenness (a characteristic related with binge drinking). It may be that women, regardless of neighborhood poverty have similar norms and attitudes about drinking. This could explain the similar associations between neighborhood impoverishment and alcohol outlets for women in poverty and nonpoverty neighborhoods. Alternatively, drinking and depression could represent different, but parallel ways of reacting to stressors for men and women, respectively (Thoits, 1995).\n",
      "\n",
      "Our finding that AOD was not associated with binge drinking or alcohol-related problems among drinkers is somewhat surprising. Although studies of AOD and individual-level alcohol intake have been mixed (Gruenewald et al., 2002; Pollack et al., 2005; Scribner et al., 2000), many ecological studies have found positive associations between AOD and alcohol-related harms, for example, sexually transmitted diseases, motor vehicle accidents, and homicide and other violence (Cohen et al., 2006; Scribner et al., 1999; Treno et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2004) and alcohol sales (Gruenewald, Ponicki, & Holder, 1993), which suggest that greater AOD increases individuals’ alcohol intake in that vicinity. In post hoc analysis, our binary measure of AOD showed a strong, positive association with binge drinking. However, this secondary analysis should be interpreted cautiously given it was exploratory, not hypothesized a priori and therefore may be more likely to have occurred by chance. This finding may nonetheless guide future researchers to consider whether a threshold or other measure of AOD may be a better parameterization for estimating associations between AOD and individual-level drinking measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, ecological studies examining AOD and alcohol-related harms generally do not have information about the drinking status of individuals at the time the event occurred. It may be that those who experienced the harm were not drinking or may not have alcohol-related problems when it took place. Thus, there may be no association between AOD and individuals’ alcohol intake and the observed relationship with AOD may be related to other factors. For example, alternative mechanisms plausibly linking greater AOD and IPV include: (a) the loosening of normative controls against violence in disorganized neighborhoods where the number of alcohol outlets are often greater and (b) the clustering of high-risk couples in such disorganized neighborhoods (Cunradi, 2010).Furthermore, given that AOD is positively correlated with neighborhood poverty (Pollack et al., 2005), by adjusting for neighborhood poverty we may have accounted for the influence of AOD on binge drinking and alcohol-related problems. Then again, census tracts were not geographically nested within zip code boundaries, and we may have been unable to completely account for census tract–level poverty when estimating associations for AOD (and vice versa). Most studies of AOD and alcohol-related harms also do not account for individual-level sociodemographic and behavioral factors. That we were able to account for such factors could be responsible for our seemingly contradictory results. This explanation seems unlikely given that estimates for AOD were similar whether we adjusted for individual-level factors and that unadjusted estimates showed no association between AOD and binge drinking or alcohol-related problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations of the measure of AOD, which was only available at the zip code level, may have precluded us from being able to identify associations. Our census tract–level measure of neighborhood poverty may have been a more valid and robust measure than AOD and as such, better able to detect variations in binge drinking and alcohol-related problems. Zip code–level measures of neighborhood characteristics appear less sensitive to variations in health outcomes than smaller units such as census tracts or blocks (Krieger et al., 2003a). However, in a related article (McKinney et al., 2009) based on this same survey data set we found that AOD was positively associated with IPV. We did not have the data to examine AOD using other types of measures such as number of roadway miles; others who have examined AOD using both geographic and population density measures have found that these measures yield similar findings (Scribner et al., 1999). We were also unable to analyze AOD according to specific types of alcohol outlets that may be particularly related to the examined drinking outcomes. In some studies, bars contribute disproportionately to alcohol-related social problems (Gruenewald et al., 2002; Gruenewald, Freisthler, Remer, Lascala, & Treno, 2006; Gruenewald & Remer, 2006; LaVeist & Wallace, 2000; Pollack et al., 2005). Similarly, convenience stores typically sell cold, ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages for quick consumption in large quantities (LaVeist & Wallace, 2000) and have long hours of operation. These settings may confer greater risks for binge drinking or alcohol-related problems than other types of alcohol outlets.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is, the association between AOD and binge drinking or alcohol-related problems may exist but our inability to measure it accurately could have precluded us from observing the association. Our measure of AOD was likely subject to nondifferential misclassification since alcohol outlet data on sole proprietors and family-owned businesses were not collected by the U.S. Economic Census and we were unable to incorporate detailed alcohol-licensing laws for counties or cities into our estimates of AOD. Our measure of AOD was based on 1997 data (and poverty was based on 1990 data) and may not correspond with the environment in 1995, the time individual-level respondent data was collected and may be another source of nondifferential misclassification. In addition, where some respondents procured their alcohol may not be in the zip code in which an individual lives. These sources of misclassification may have biased our estimates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our findings can be generalized to drinkers who are married or cohabiting, but may not be representative of drinkers not living with a partner who may be younger and more likely to binge drink (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2006). Data from 1995 may not be reflective of the current situation. For example our survey collected information on binge drinking defined as ≥5 drinks for both men and women, but binge drinking was redefined in 2004 as ≥4 drinks among women and ≥5 among men (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2004). As fewer women would report binge drinking at ≥5 drinks than ≥4 drinks, more women would have been classified in the lower binge drinking categories (none or ≥0–3); this would bias our estimates for women drinkers toward the null. Our categorization of binge drinking was intended to capture associations of AOD and neighborhood poverty related to high-frequency binge drinking. However, our measure may not have captured certain characteristics such as the duration of this binge drinking (e.g., for how long a respondent had been binge drinking ≥4 times per month) or the peak number of drinks per binge drinking occasion. Thus, we may have not captured drinking patterns most likely associated with AOD. This notion is consistent with the “prevention paradox” which notes that drinking problems commonly occur during drinking that is generally typical (Rossow & Romelsjo, 2006; Spurling & Vinson, 2005).\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, these findings provide new information about associations of AOD and neighborhood poverty with binge drinking and alcohol-related problems in a population of married and cohabitating drinkers. Our findings suggest that male drinkers who live in high-poverty areas are at increased odds of binge drinking and having alcohol-related problems relative to male drinkers living in more affluent areas. Efforts to reduce these alcohol outcomes may have the most impact if targeted to this subpopulation. To build on this study, future research could use other analytical approaches such as structural equation modeling to detail the interrelationships between AOD, neighborhood poverty, and drinking outcomes (i.e., binge drinking and alcohol-related problems) in predicting IPV, and formally test binge drinking and alcohol-related problems as mediating variables. Our analysis used an epidemiologic approach; a geospatial approach may offer further insight. In addition, a more detailed measure of AOD at a smaller level such as census tract and being able to delineate specific types of outlets could help clarify the relationship between AOD and binge drinking and alcohol-related problems.\n",

Once again, you have a powerful feeling (loving one’s ancestry) that is forced to be repressed due to far-left ideology. This isn’t healthy, and it isn’t fair. Europeans did some dark shit, without question. But every race and group you can name did similar things if look at the history. We should all be ashamed, and we should all be proud. Anytime you remove one either of these feelings, for any group, you produce a festering and boiling pressure that can only be ugly when it finally says something. Insisting that no part of gender or racial representation in various industries/careers has anything to do with their respective interests or talents. The far left wants you to believe that all workforces should have a gender and race distribution that perfectly matches the overall population distribution.

      "Fortnite is a 'battle royale' video game. Battle royale is a relatively new genre of shooter, in which 100 players airdrop on an island, and fight by themselves or in small teams. When a player dies, they stay dead for that match. The last player (or team) standing wins the whole thing. The genre started in the mod scene for games like DayZ, Arma 3, and H1Z1, but didn't take off until the release of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. PlayerUnknown is the screen name of the modder who made battle royale mods before he released Battlegrounds. When he did, it became incredibly popular.\n",
      "\n",
      "Battlegrounds was so popular, many game companies tried to copy it. Epic Games was already testing a game called Fortnite at the time, in which players build defenses against hordes of monsters. Think of it like a shooter mixed in with some Minecraft. It wasn't a huge success, but Epic Games saw the success of Battlegrounds, tweaked their game to create a battle royale mode, and Fortnite Battle Royale was born. It almost immediately became bigger than the original game, and is now a huge hit.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's kind of surprising because it's a copy of a game that was already dominant, and because I would argue it's much more complicated (in Battlegrounds players just run around and shoot, in Fortnite they have to run around and shoot AND constantly build defenses). It's less surprising when you consider it has a brighter, more colorful look, and that it combines two of the most popular video games in recent history: Battlegrounds and Minecraft. Also, it's free, and Battlegrounds is not.\n",

      "Sometimes science produces findings that I really, really hate. That’s the case with a recent study published in the journal Psychological Science in January 2018, which suggests that a proclivity for divorce runs in our genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study, conducted by researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University and Lund University, comes to this conclusion by comparing the divorce rates of nearly 20,000 adopted children in Sweden to the divorce rates of their biological parents. The research only looks at children adopted before the age of 10. They estimate that children with biological parents who were divorced were a little over 20% more likely get divorced themselves. As for the effect of having divorced adoptive parents? It had no impact at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another test of the effect of genes versus environment, the researchers compared adopted children’s chances of getting divorced to both biological siblings with whom they hadn’t grown up, and to adoptive siblings with whom they were raised. Again, they found that biology seemed to be a factor, while shared rearing was not.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no specific divorce gene, write the researchers. But their research clearly shows divorce is correlated to genetics.\n",
      "\n",
      "This finding seems terrible. It’s scary to consider the idea that nature, rather than nurture, plays such a large role in determining the outcomes of our relationships. It makes life feel too determined. The research also contradicts my worldview that the results of our lives are almost entirely a consequence of the privileges of our upbringing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I was biased against the finding, I set out to figure out what was wrong with it. Was there a methodological flaw? An issue with the data?\n",
      "\n",
      "I wrote to several researchers who investigate similar topics, all of whom I hold in high regard. I asked if the study was well designed, confident they would tell me it wasn’t. To my dismay, the reviews came back positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dartmouth economist Bruce Sacredote, who has researched the importance of nature versus nurture for economic outcomes, called the study “sensible and interesting.” Princeton sociologist Dalton Conley, who co-authored a book about why social scientists should study genetics, said the study was “a good piece of research.” Conley did point out that the effect of the biological parents could partially result from the time that adopted children spend with their biological parents prenatally and after birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another limitation of this research, as with many studies, is that is based on a specific sample of kids, in a particular country, in a particular time. It is possible the genetic relationship to divorce is stronger in Sweden because of particular cultural values or the genetic makeup of Swedes. Also, it’s not clear exactly how strong the correlation is between divorce rates of biological parents and the divorce rates of children they gave up for adoption. Their best estimate is that a divorced biological parents increases the chances that a child they gave up for adoption will get divorced by 22%, but statistical variance suggests it could easily be 10% less than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, it looks like the study’s findings hold up. We probably should believe that genetics play a significant role in the likelihood that people will get divorced—probably even a bigger one than our environment. That gives me chills. I still hope it is proven wrong.\n",

From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on more than 40 campaigns globally. Many of SCL’s projects are secret, so that may be a low estimate. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He has been both hailed as a visionary – featuring on Wired’s list of “25 Geniuses who are creating the future of business” – and derided as a snake oil salesman.

      "While leaks may be published with malicious intent, I see an opportunity here for the us to make ourselves a bit more secure online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passwords, by definition, are meant to be secret. If it weren't for these leaks, we might not have any idea what a password looks like. Sure, we might know the password to a friend's home Wifi network, or for a company expense account, but passwords are usually only intended to be known by the user and an authentication system.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, consider this:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are never supposed to tell me yours, and I am never going to tell you mine...\n",

      "The How\n",
      "\n",
      "While studying password wordlists, I noticed most were either sorted alphabetically or not sorted at all. This might be okay computerized analysis, but I wanted to learn something about the way people think.\n",
      "\n",
      "I determined that for the most practical analysis, lists had to be sorted in a manner that reflected actual human behavior, not an arbitrary alphabet system or random chronology.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the better part of a year, I went to sites like SecLists, Weakpass, and Hashes.org to download nearly every single Wordlist containing real passwords I could find. After attempting to remove non-pertinent information, this harvest yielded 1600 files spanning more than 350GB worth of leaked passwords.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each file, I removed internal duplicates and ensured that they all used the same style of newline character. Some of these lists were composed of smaller lists, and some lists were exact copies, but I took care that the source material was as \"pure\" as possible. Then, all files were combined into a single amalgamation that represented all of the source files.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each time a password was found in this file represented a time it was found in the source materials. I considered the number of times a password was found across all of the files to be an approximation of its overall popularity. If an entry was found in less than 5 files, it isn't commonly used. But, if an entry could be found more than 350 files, it is incredibly popular. The passwords that were found in the highest number of source files are considered to be the most popular and are placed at top of the list. Files that didn't appear frequently were placed at the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The giant source file represented nearly 13 billion passwords! However, since this project aims to find the most popular passwords, and not just list as many passwords as I could find, a password needed to be found at least 5 times in analysis to be included on these lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end result is a list of approximately 2 Billion real passwords, sorted in order of their popularity, not by the alphabet.\n",

      "In what is a first not only for Afrika but the world, the country used a blockchain solution to tally, and provide proof of, the recently held elections in the country. The blockchain solution used was developed by a Switzerland based voting technology company, Agora.\n",

The team is engaged in Sierra Leone’s presidential elections, and we are in Freetown with our partners, the European Commission, helping our blockchain node operators (Red Cross, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, University of Fribourg) audit today’s election results. We are proud to announce that our results in the western district are 2 hours ahead of the National Election Commission and all NGOs, with 86% tallied. I’ll get back to you later tonight with more,” said Leonardo Gammar, CEO at Agora, in the company’s Telegram group as tallying of votes was underway on March 7th, 2018.\n",

      "A blockchain based solution that uses a publicly visible ledger for keeping track of elections could complement, or even replace, electronic voting machines. Currently, opposition politicians in the Democratic Republic of Congo are opposed to the use of electronic voting machines as they feel these can be hacked and the results manipulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“First, people in Sierra Leone want to vote in peace and have hope. They are also very brave! There is no private transportation allowed so they had to take the buses to the polling centers which is quite a difficult task here. It has been humbling to see and take part in. I’d like to show my respect for our observers out here who has sometimes no choice but to walk for hours to take part in peaceful and transparent elections. I’ve learned that a country doesn’t need to have impressive infrastructures to start working towards democracy and technical improvements. I am grateful to Sierra Leone for showing the world how visionary they are and take the chance on us so we can continue to figure out how to build a custom blockchain for their governance needs. These challenges are where we find our strengths. If we can make it happen in SL we can make happen everywhere around the earth. Thank you Eran, see you soon!” concluded Gammar.\n",

      "After the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February, the top trending video on YouTube wasn’t a news clip about the tragedy, but a conspiracy theory video suggesting survivor David Hogg was an actor. The video garnered 200,000 views before YouTube removed it from its platform. Until now, the company hasn’t said much about how it plans to handle the spread of that sort of misinformation moving forward. On Tuesday, however, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki detailed a potential solution. YouTube will now begin displaying links to fact-based content alongside conspiracy theory videos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wojcicki announced the new feature, which she called \"information cues,\" during a talk with WIRED editor-in-chief Nicholas Thompson at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas. Here’s how it will work: If you search and click on a conspiracy theory video about, say, chemtrails, YouTube will now link to a Wikipedia page that debunks the hoax alongside the video. A video calling into question whether humans have ever landed on the moon might be accompanied by the official Wikipedia page about the Apollo Moon landing in 1969. Wojcicki says the feature will only include conspiracy theories right now that have \"significant debate\" on the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Youtube\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our goal is to start with a list of internet conspiracies listed on the internet where there is a lot of active discussion on YouTube,\" Wojcicki said at SXSW.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision to include links to other websites represents a dramatic shift for YouTube, which has historically existed as a mostly contained ecosystem. It’s also notable that YouTube chose to link out to text-based sites, rather than rearrange its own search algorithm to further favor content from truthful creators and video journalists. One reason for the decision might be that YouTube wants to avoid the perception that it’s rigging its platform to favor certain creators, a criticism it has faced in the past. It also prevents YouTube from having to censor content outright, serving as the ultimate arbiter of truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"People can still watch the videos, but then they have access to additional information,\" said Wojcicki.\n",
      "\n",
      "Merely placing links to factual information alongside videos won’t solve the company’s moderation problems wholesale. For one, as Zeynep Tufekci at The New York Times and others have pointed out, YouTube’s recommendation algorithm is often how users end up seeing conspiracy theories in the first place. Wikipedia in particular can also be edited by anyone, and has had its own reliability issues in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem with the recommendation algorithm is that it feeds users ever-more extreme content, sometimes straying from what they searched for in the first place. For example, if you search for a video about the Holocaust, YouTube might recommend that you then watch one about how the tragedy was a hoax. The recommendation system isn’t designed to ensure you’re informed; its main objective is to keep you consuming YouTube videos for as long as possible. What that entails has mostly been an afterthought. Even if every conspiracy video is served up with a Wikipedia article contradicting the information that it presents, there's no guarantee that users will choose to read it over the video they've already clicked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take, for example, what happens when you search conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ videos about the Parkland shooting. After watching one, YouTube recommends you then watch another of Jones’ videos, this time about how the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax. It doesn't suggest that you watch a factual clip about Parkland or Sandy Hook at all. YouTube’s algorithm system serves to radicalize users, and until that’s fixed, the company will likely continue to suffer from scandals related to misinformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "YouTube has also still yet to decide and implement clear rules for when uploading conspiracy theory content violates its Community Guidelines. Nothing in the rules explicitly prevents creators from publishing videos featuring conspiracy theories or misleading information, but lately YouTube has been cracking down on accounts that spread hoaxes anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "'People can still watch the videos, but then they have access to additional information.' Susan Wojcicki, YouTube\n",
      "\n",
      "In the wake of the Parkland shooting for example, YouTube reportedly issued a “strike” against Jones for uploading a video accusing Hogg of being an actor (this video was separate from the one that trended on the platform). But Jones and his organization InfoWars have been uploading videos to YouTube prompting lies, hate speech, and false conspiracy theories for years, leaving YouTube’s users and creators to guess what’s actually permitted. Often it seems the platform reacts primarily in response to public outcry, which makes its moderation decisions inconsistent. Until YouTube has outlined a clear policy for how it wants to regulate misinformation, its new efforts to introduce text-based links won’t entirely be effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Merely serving up factual information has also not been a cure-all for other platforms that have suffered from scandals associated with misinformation, like YouTube’s parent company Alphabet and Facebook. Both Google News and Facebook’s trending bar have surfaced conspiracy theories during breaking news events in the past, despite having plenty of links to more reputable news sites on their platforms. It's remarkable, too, that an enormous platform, equipped with a flow of advertising cash, has chosen to address its misinformation problem primarily using the work of a donation-funded volunteer encyclopedia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another obvious question here is whether Wikipedia and YouTube will be able to keep up with with breaking news events that quickly fall prey to conspiracy theories. For example, the Parkland shooting survivors were accused of being actors within hours of the tragedy. It's unclear how quickly YouTube will be able to add links to the thousands of misinformation videos that are uploaded every time a major news event occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still though, YouTube should be applauded for doing something to try to fight conspiracy theories, especially since adding links elsewhere will do nothing to immediately aid its bottom line.\n",

      "Coronary artery disease pathogenesis and treatment urgently requires a paradigm shift. Despite popular belief among doctors and the public, the conceptual model of dietary saturated fat clogging a pipe is just plain wrong. A landmark systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies showed no association between saturated fat consumption and (1) all-cause mortality, (2) coronary heart disease (CHD), (3) CHD mortality, (4) ischaemic stroke or (5) type 2 diabetes in healthy adults.1 Similarly in the secondary prevention of CHD there is no benefit from reduced fat, including saturated fat, on myocardial infarction, cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.2 It is instructive to note that in an angiographic study of postmenopausal women with CHD, greater intake of saturated fat was associated with less progression of atherosclerosis whereas carbohydrate and polyunsaturated fat intake were associated with greater progression.3\n",
      "\n",
      "Preventing the development of atherosclerosis is important but it is atherothrombosis that is the real killer The inflammatory processes that contribute to cholesterol deposition within the artery wall and subsequent plaque formation (atherosclerosis), more closely resembles a ‘pimple’ (figure 1). Most cardiac events occur at sites with <70% coronary artery obstruction and these do not generate ischaemia on stress testing.4 When plaques rupture (analogous to a pimple bursting), coronary thrombosis and myocardial infarction can occur within minutes. The limitation of the current plumbing approach (‘unclogging a pipe’) to the management of coronary disease is revealed by a series of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which prove that stenting significantly obstructive stable lesions fail to prevent myocardial infarction or to reduce mortality.5 Figure 1 Lifestyle interventions for the prevention and treatment of coronary disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dietary RCTs with outcome benefit in primary and secondary prevention In comparison with advice to follow a ‘low fat’ diet (37% fat), an energy-unrestricted Mediterranean diet (41% fat) supplemented with at least four tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil or a handful of nuts (PREDIMED) achieved a significant 30% (number needed to treat (NNT)=61) reduction in cardiovascular events in over 7500 high-risk patients. Furthermore, the Lyon Heart study showed that adopting a Mediterranean diet in secondary prevention improved hard outcomes for both recurrent myocardial infarction (NNT=18) and all-cause mortality (NNT=30), despite there being no significant difference in plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol between the two groups. It is the alpha linoleic acid, polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids present in nuts, extra virgin olive oil, vegetables and oily fish that rapidly attenuate inflammation and coronary thrombosis.6 Both control diets in these studies were relatively healthy, which make it highly likely that even larger benefits would be observed if the Mediterranean diets discussed above were compared with a typical western diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "LDL cholesterol risk has been exaggerated Decades of emphasis on the primacy of lowering plasma cholesterol, as if this was an end in itself and driving a market of ‘proven to lower cholesterol’ and ‘low-fat’ foods and medications, has been misguided. Selective reporting may partly explain this misconception. Reanalysis of unpublished data from the Sydney Diet Heart Study and the Minnesota coronary experiment reveal replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid containing vegetable oils increased mortality risk despite significant reductions in LDL and total cholesterol (TC).7 A high TC to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio is the best predictor of cardiovascular risk (hence this calculation, not LDL, is used in recognised cardiovascular risk calculators such as that from Framingham). A high TC to HDL ratio is also a surrogate marker for insulin resistance (ie, chronically elevated serum insulin at the root of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity). And in those over 60 years, a recent systematic review concluded that LDL cholesterol is not associated with cardiovascular disease and is inversely associated with all-cause mortality.8 A high TC to HDL ratio drops rapidly with dietary changes such as replacing refined carbohydrates with healthy high fat foods.\n",

      "A simple way to combat insulin resistance (chronically high levels of serum insulin) and inflammation Compared with physically inactive individuals, those who walk briskly at or above 150 min/week can increase life expectancy by 3.4–4.5 years independent of body weight.9 Regular brisk walking may also be more effective than running in preventing coronary disease. And just 30 min of moderate activity a day more than three times/week significantly improves insulin sensitivity and helps reverse insulin resistance (ie, lowers the chronically elevated levels of insulin that are associated with obesity) within months in sedentary middle-aged adults. This occurs independent of weight loss and suggests even a little activity goes a long way. Another risk factor for CHD is environmental stress. Childhood trauma can lead to an average decrease in life expectancy of 20 years. Chronic stress increases glucocorticoid receptor resistance, which results in failure to down regulate the inflammatory response. Combining a complete lifestyle approach of a healthful diet, regular movement and stress reduction will improve quality of life, reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.10 It is time to shift the public health message in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease away from measuring serum lipids and reducing dietary saturated fat. Coronary artery disease is a chronic inflammatory disease and it can be reduced effectively by walking 22 min a day and eating real food. There is no business model or market to help spread this simple yet powerful intervention.\n",

      "Kier Pritchard, temporary Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police, said a number of people were taken to hospital after exposure to the nerve agent which has left Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia fighting for life.\n",

      "Several of the force’s officers are among those who have been treated, he said.\n",

      "“A number of those have been through the hospital treatment process. They’re having blood tests, they’ve having treatment in terms of support and advice provided.”\n",

      "Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter, 33, remain critically ill in intensive care after they were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. Detectives believe they were targeted in an assassination attempt.\n",

      "Mr Bailey is the only police officer who remains in hospital in connection to the poisoning, said Mr Pritchard, who added it was too soon to say if he would make a full recovery.\n",

      "The Chief Constable said: “We’re going to have to wait to see on that... He’s well, he’s sat up. He is not the Nick that I know but of course he’s receiving a high level of treatment. He’s in the safe hands of the medical professionals.\n",

      "China and Vulnerability Research\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Thoughts\n",
      "\n",
      "For the last few years Chinese vulnerability research teams have dominated the exploit competitions around the world. As I wrote before, this is because the major Chinese technology companies are in a battle for cybersecurity mindshare in the Chinese market. They use the CVE assignments, exploit competition wins and recognition from major software vendors as demonstrations of their expertise in cyber security. It is roughly like Bugtraq in the 1990s.\n",
      "\n",
      "To encourage their teams to enter and win exploit contests the companies have various incentive structures, for example the team members keep the winnings and some companies even pay bonuses for winning entries. These are dream jobs for many hackers: full time research; high salary; big bonuses; international travel, and recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The companies also get value for their investment, their marketing departments are able to exploit the international recognition to full effect. There is a clear win-win relationship between the vulnerability research teams and the companies. So far, so good.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year there was a change. Security forces informed the major companies involved in international exploit competitions that the rules for vulnerability handling has changed: no third parties, only direct to the vendor. For someone who is not familiar with how a context-rich society works, this may sound like an opportunity for language lawyering and quibbling about the definition of third party. This line of thinking is misguided, at best.\n",
      "\n",
      "First one must realise that this is not a new law, but rather a policy change issued by the police. That means the police are responsible for interpreting whether an action is in violation of the policy. Fundamentally, that means “obey the intent of the new policy” because there is no “letter of the law” to follow. For Westeners this may seem confusing, but it is critical to understand that the wording of the policy is less important than the intent of the officials who issued it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brings up the far more interesting question: what is the intent of this new policy? It is important to know whether this is a temporary measure because officials have decided that right now is particularly sensitive and they don’t want the attention. Or, whether this is a permanent policy change and will remain in place for a long period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this is temporary (say, a year or less), then the effects will likely be minimal. Companies and researchers will simply wait it out and emerge with even more exploits to show off. However, if this is a permanent change then the implications are extremely interesting. For the sake of argument, lets assume that this is a long term policy. What does that mean for the Chinese cyber security community?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming the restriction is long lasting the first order effects will impact both the companies and the researchers. The companies will lose a substantial marketing vector and maintaining huge research teams will be a financial drain with little in the way of ROI. Reducing the size of their vulnerability research teams will make sound financial sense. The researchers will also lose out on a lot of major perks: international travel and recognition, plus a substantial portion of their take home pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remaining as a researcher at a company that cannot participate in exploit competitions is a lot less attractive than alternatives. Working at a small national security cyber defense company will provide the same full time research work, be patriotic, and offer significantly more lucrative income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, if the policy change is long term, the effects will be to incentivize the trained and motivated vulnerability research teams to leave their existing roles and become part of the natsec fabric. Simultaneously, the companies employing these huge teams will be incentivized to reduce the size of the research units to bring them inline with the ROI of “11pt Arial font” marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, either this is just a temporary change and the Chinese teams will be dominating pwn2own again in no time, or this is an extremely clever social engineering maneuver to grow China’s indigenous offensive cyber security capacity. Time will tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update:\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a good way to detect what impact the policy change is having on the Chinese research teams, because their output is directly available in security vulnerabilities from major vendors. There will be a lag as the old reported vulnerabilities are cleared away, but if the volume of Chinese teams in the acknowledgements of Microsoft, Android and Apple security advisories drops, then the outside observer can measure the impact. That’s the metric to watch now, the acknowledgements in security updates.\n",

      "New Research Claims Bones Found 80 Years Ago On Pacific Atoll Likely Amelia Earhart's\n",
      "\n",
      "Enlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no shortage of speculation on what became of legendary American aviator Amelia Earhart, who disappeared in 1937 over the Pacific during an attempt to circumnavigate the globe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Richard Jantz, a researcher affiliated with the University of Tennessee, has re-examined data from bones found on a remote atoll three years after Earhart vanished and has determined they very likely belonged to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three main theories about Earhart's disappearance — arguably the most enduring aviation mystery in history — have been bandied about over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first (and simplest) is that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan, flying their Lockheed Electra 10E, simply ran out of fuel and crashed into the vast Pacific Ocean short of Howland Island, where they were expected to land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another theory has it that Earhart (and possibly Noonan) survived a crash landing and that, at least, she was taken prisoner by Japanese forces, who were expanding their reach in the region in the lead-up to World War II.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet another one is that the Lockheed Electra crashed on or near Nikumaroro Island, about 400 miles south of Howland, probably as a result of a navigation error. Nikumaroro, then known as Gardner Island, is a tiny coral ring that is part of current-day Kiribati.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is this last theory that the new analysis by Jantz, a professor emeritus of anthropology and director emeritus of the University of Tennessee's Forensic Anthropology Center, supports.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took a closer look at data gathered in 1940 from skeletal remains recovered by a British expedition to Nikumaroro. The British found a human skull, humeri and radii (both arm bones), a tibia and fibula from the lower leg and two femurs (thigh bones). The bones were sent to Fiji, where they were examined and measured by physician D.W. Hoodless.\n",
      "\n",
      "History Did Amelia Earhart Survive Plane Crash? Newly Discovered Photo Offers Clues Did Amelia Earhart Survive Plane Crash? Newly Discovered Photo Offers Clues Listen · 3:45 3:45\n",
      "\n",
      "But the bones themselves are long gone. After Hoodless examined them, and determining them to be from a stocky European male, they disappeared. The assumption is that either he or someone else in Fiji discarded them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jantz, working with the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, which has been big into Earhart research for years, ran the measurements taken by Hoodless 80 years ago through Fordisc, \"a computer program for estimating sex, ancestry, and stature from skeletal measurements,\" according to a statement from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.\n",
      "\n",
      "The analysis \"found that Hoodless had incorrectly determined the sex of the remains. [Fordisc], co-created by Jantz, is used by nearly every board-certified forensic anthropologist in the US and around the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The data revealed that the bones have more similarity to Earhart than to 99 percent of individuals in a large reference sample,\" the statement said.\n",
      "\n",
      "NPR's Christopher Joyce reported on All Things Considered back in 1998 about a similar but presumably less sophisticated analysis that determined the bones were female.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hoodless had 13 bones to work with, including the skull and some long bones from the legs and arms,\" Christopher reported at the time. \"His conclusion, was that the bones belonged to a European, but a European male\" and that they were from an individual about 5 feet, 6 inches — shorter than Earhart's 5 feet, 9 inches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using \"scaleable objects\" in photos of Earhart and examination of the inseam of some of her trousers found in archives, Jantz and another forensic analyst, Jeff Glickman, determined that Earhart was a bit shorter than that — 5 feet, 7 inches or 5 feet, 8 inches. Her pilot's license also apparently lists Earhart as 5 feet, 7 inches. In photographs of Earhart and Noonan, he stands several inches taller than she.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enlarge this image toggle caption Topical Press Agency/Getty Images Topical Press Agency/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine the height of the person whose skeletal remains were examined, Jantz compared the ratio of the humerus to the radius, which came out to 0.756. The average for a mid-20th century female was 0.73, but Earhart was a bit taller than average. From the photo analysis, Glickman says Earhart's ratio should have been 0.76.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, that all depends on a few things: Were the measurements taken by Hoodless accurate? (And if, as we speculate, Hoodless didn't know the potential historical importance of the remains, how carefully were they taken?) And how accurate was the photo analysis? Even a small variation might put the calculations off.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we still had the bones, that might clear things up. So why would Hoodless have thrown them out?\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1929, the SS Norwich City, an English steamer, had wrecked off the coast of Gardner Island with the loss of 11 of the vessel's crew of 35. Hoodless might have thought he was looking at remains from that shipwreck. (Jantz says that in his analysis, he has ruled out that the remains could be any of the shipwrecked sailors.)\n",
      "\n",
      "It might also be true that in 1940, the prevailing theory of Earhart's disappearance was probably that her plane ran out of fuel just short of Howland and crashed into the open ocean. That was the official explanation being offered by the U.S. government. This would seem to give further weight to the notion that Hoodless probably did not think he was looking at anything of historical importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When Hoodless conducted his analysis, forensic osteology was not yet a well-developed discipline,\" Jantz explains in the published research in the journal Forensic Anthropology. \"Evaluating his methods with reference to modern data and methods suggests that they were inadequate to his task; this is particularly the case with his sexing method. Therefore his sex assessment of the Nikumaroro bones cannot be assumed to be correct.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, Jantz acknowledges that a 2015 study found the techniques employed by Hoodless were \"sound and therefore his sex estimate was likely correct.\"\n",

      "The web-watchers at W3Techs have just noted a milestone: WordPress now accounts for 30 per cent of the world's websites.\n",
      "\n",
      "W3Techs crawls the top 10 million websites as determined by Amazon's Alexa rating service and peers into their innards to figure out what they're running, and sells details reports on its findings. It also publishes public data on its findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on Monday March 5, that public data recorded that WordPress's share of the top 10 million websites had ticked over from 29.9 per cent to 30 per cent. The firm put some context on that data by noting that 50.2 per cent of the world's websites don't run a content management system (CMS) at all. That means WordPress has over 60 per cent share among websites that do run a CMS. That's a dominance few products in any category can claim.\n",

      "WordPress 4.9: This one's for you, developers! READ MORE\n",

      "\n",
      "Also worth considering is that open source dominates the CMS market: Joomla is open source and so are the next two most-used CMSes, Drupal and Magento.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another oddity: Squarespace and Wix, both of which advertise heavily to small business, have 0.9 and 0.5 per cent share among CMS-users respectively.\n",

      "BARCELONA, ESP – Today ASUS is launching a smartphone that is designed, according to the speaker at our prebriefing, to make it look like the user is holding an iPhone X. The new ASUS ZenFone 5, part of the ZenFone 5 family, comes with a notch. Apparently this is what the company says that its customers want: the ability to look as if you have an iPhone X, but have something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from the notch, ASUS’ ZenFone 5 launch today actually comprises of three different devices: the ZenFone 5, the ZenFone 5 Lite (called the ZenFone 5Q in most of the world) and the ZenFone 5Z. We were given a pre-brief of the first two devices, with the flagship ZenFone 5Z only being revealed at the press event at Mobile World Congress.\n",

      "ASUS’ history with the ZenFone family has gone through highs and lows, from the ever popular ZenFone 2 through to the mass of dozens of ZenFone 3 variants that were difficult to keep track of. For ZF5 ASUS is sticking to three, and the standard ZF5 is set to sit in the middle of that stack. Despite sitting in the middle, ASUS was keen to point out some of the high profile features.\n",
      "\n",
      "The display specifications involve a 6.2-inch display, listed as a 19:9 aspect ratio, and a Full-HD+ resolution (2160x1080). ASUS is quoting 500 nits of brightness, a 1500:1 contrast ratio, and support 100% of the DCI-P3 color space. The display also comes with Glove Touch support, which can be enabled through the settings. ASUS has supposedly implemented AI here, as part of its AI strategy, such that the system can use an onboard RGB sensor and apply screen color/brightness adjustments to react to ambient lighting. We were told that this goes beyond just regular brightness and dimming in bright light, but when pressed, we were told that this ‘artificial intelligence’ feature was not based on any form of machine learning. More on this later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from the display, ASUS wanted to highlight its camera solution. The handset has a dual rear camera setup, with the second camera being a wide-angle lens. The main rear camera is a 12MP Sony IMX363 sensor, with an f/1.8 aperture, 1.4 micron pixels, and OIS/EIS. The secondary rear camera is just listed as an 8MP unit with F/2.2 aperture and a 120-degree field of view. Underneath is a fingerprint sensor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rear cameras are combined with machine learning software, which will detect up to 16 different scenes and objects, including people, food, snow, stage, flowers, text, and others. The system will apply a series of color saturation, white balance, exposure, and sharpness/noise adjustments to the camera settings to provide a better shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of helping with taking shots, this AI is going to be combined with another AI related to photo learning. For post processing, the system will offer a number of suggested edits to the picture, and ask the user if they want to accept the changes. Over time the idea is that the system will understand the preferred settings of each user for each different type of scene and use them to help manage the pre-shot AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "The front facing camera is an 8MP unit as well, but with f/2.0 aperture. This camera will be used for ASUS’ Face Unlock feature, which was explained as being important for environments that use gloves a lot (our presenter was based in the Nordic countries).\n",
      "\n",
      "On the SoC side, the ZF5 is using a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor, which has eight Kryo 260 cores running at 1.8 GHz, built on Samsung’s 14LPP process, and with Adreno 509 graphics. This SoC will be paired with up to 6 GB of LPDDR4X, and up to 128 GB of storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASUS was keen to point out the audio functionality, with dual NXP9874 smart amps in place – one for each speaker. The effect in person over the previous ZenFone 4, and some other flagship devices, was substantial for speakers in a regular position for a smartphone. ASUS also stated the ZenFone 5 as the world’s first smartphone with DTS Headphone X support, providing a 7.1 virtual surround sound. These features tie into ASUS’ AudioWizard tool that offers different listening profiles depending on what headphones are used – an external audio tuning company has enabled profiles for over 400 types of commercial headphones and when enabled on the ZF5 will adjust the frequency response accordingly. There is also a personal 60-second test to help the system adjust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another feature is ‘AI Charging’, the idea that most users charge their phone every night at a similar time, so the system will learn the usual method and adjust the charging profile to match. The key here is that batteries last longest when they are mostly charged, rather than fully charged. So rather than spending the first two hours in the night charging, and staying at 100% the next six hours, the system will hold the battery level at 80% and then push to 100% near to when you are expected to rise. This is meant to be implemented through machine learning, and can take up to three weeks to learn. For users with a regular schedule, this might work well – although I can imagine the frustration of having to wake up early one morning and only finding the phone 80% charged.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASUS has included a feature called ‘AI Boost’, which has nothing to do with machine learning. From what I was able to determine from the marketing team at the pre-brief, this feature enables all the cores to run locked at their peak frequency, which has the potential to boost performance. ASUS decided showing benchmarking results of Antutu was the best strategy here, with a +50% performance jump. We performed a quick test on the Jetstream benchmark, which showed an 18% performance gain with the mode on. The fact that this tool has nothing to do with the definition of artificial intelligence or machine learning is indicative of ASUS’ smartphone marketing team new strategy of calling everything AI. This reminds me of a very specific comic strip about how people misuse the term AI.\n",

      "Two artificial intelligence systems built by Google are able to transform a heavily pixellated, low quality, image into a clear photo or a person or object.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer scientists from Google Brain, the central Google AI team, have shown it's not only possible to enhance a picture's resolution, they can fill in missing details in the process. In a paper – Pixel Recursive Super Resolution – three researchers from the Silicon Valley firm trained their system on small 8x8 pixel images of celebrity faces and photos of bedrooms.\n",

      "The combination of a conditioning neural network and a prior neural network analysed the images to produce higher resolution 32x32 pixel versions. The process sees a blurry, almost unrecognisable, picture turned into something that clearly represents a human or a room.\n",

      "In particular, the AI system works by taking a two-pronged approach. The conditioning network takes the low-resolution image and compares it to high-resolution images to determine whether a face or a room is in the image. It's possible to compare the low res image, the researchers explain, to a high image by scaling down the large image to the same 8x8 pixel size.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When some details do not exist in the source image, the challenge lies not only in ‘deblurring’ an image, but also in generating new image details that appear plausible to a human observer,\" the Google Brain researchers wrote in their paper.\n",

      "When both images are the same size it is relatively simple for the AI to identify similar pixels and shapes between the different versions. For example, the system can recognise an ear of a particular shape and compare it with the pixels in another image – telling the AI it is looking at a face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the first AI network has completed its role, the Google researchers use the PixelCNN to add extra pixels to the 8x8 image. As Ars Technica explained, the PixelCNN adds detail by using what it knows about certain types of images. Lips are likely to be a shade of pink, so pink pixels are added to areas identified as such.\n",

      "At the end of each neural network's process, the Google researchers combined the results to create a final image. They describe the process of adding details to how an artist works. \"By incorporating the prior knowledge of the faces and their typical variations, an artist is able to paint believable details,\" they wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "To prove the AI-generated images are believable, the researchers tested their system on human volunteers. A group of participants was shown a true, low res image, alongside the one created by the AI. They were then asked to guess which was from a camera.\n",
      "\n",
      "When looking at the images of celebrities, 10 per cent of the time the humans believed the artificially-created shot was taken by a camera. \"Note that 50 per cent would say that an algorithm perfectly confused the subjects,\" the researchers say.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the future, with further development, similar systems could be developed to add detail to pictures and video that are low resolution. One current category that lends itself to this is blurry CCTVimages. Although, the method is yet to be tested with any such databases of images and the AI creations are currently the machine's \"best guesses\" rather than entirely accurate portrayals.\n",

      "Intel has released to OEMs a new set of Spectre firmware updates. They include microcode for Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake, and Skylake processors.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This represents our 6th, 7th, and 8th Generation Intel Core product lines as well as our latest Intel Core X-series processor family. It also includes our recently announced Intel Xeon Scalable and Intel Xeon D processors for data center systems,” Navin Shenoy, general manager of the Data Center Group at Intel Corporation, pointed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The release follows that of microcode updates for some Skylake-based platforms in early February, and Intel’s January advice to stop deploying initial firmware updates that addressed Spectre (variant 2) due to a higher than expected incidence of reboots and other unpredictable system behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shenoy advised users to implement OEM firmware updates as the OEMs release them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intel also offers a constantly updated document that offers insight into the current situation regarding Spectre patches, i.e., released microcode. As can be seen, the status of the various updates varies from “planning” and “pre-beta” to “production.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsode updates for older processors using the Broadwell and Haswell cores are still in “beta”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mitigation instead of an update?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shenoy also noted the existence of a Google-developed mitigation technique for Variant 2 called Retpoline.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Retpoline’ sequences are a software construct which allow indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution. This may be applied to protect sensitive binaries (such as operating system or hypervisor implementations) from branch target injection attacks against their indirect branches,” Google explains.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The name ‘retpoline’ is a portmanteau of ‘return’ and ‘trampoline.’ It is a trampoline construct constructed using return operations which also figuratively ensures that any associated speculative execution will ‘bounce’ endlessly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Intel has provided more information on Retpoline in a newly published white paper.\n",

      "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan plans to buy at least 20 additional F-35A stealth fighters over the next six years, some or all of which it may purchase directly from Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) in the United States rather than assemble locally, three sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "FILE PHOTO: An Israeli Air Force F-35 fighter jet flies during an aerial demonstration at a graduation ceremony for Israeli air force pilots at the Hatzerim air base in southern Israel December 29, 2016. REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File Photo\n",
      "\n",
      "“In view of budgets and production schedules a new acquisition of around 25 planes is appropriate,” said one of the sources with knowledge of the plan. The sources asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sources said buying complete aircraft from the United States, at about $100 million each, will save Japan about $30 million per airframe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The purchase will add to an earlier order for 42 of the fighters, most of which are being constructed at a “final assembly and check out” plant in Japan operated by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), the country’s leading defense contractor.\n",
      "\n",
      "That plant is one of only two such factories outside the United States. The other, in Italy, is operated by Leonardo Spa (LDOF.MI).\n",
      "\n",
      "As China fields ever more advanced aircraft, including stealth planes, and as North Korea pushes ahead with its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs, adding F-35s will further increase Japan’s reliance on U.S. military technology to give it an edge over potential foes in East Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Japanese military planners are also considering buying F-35Bs, the vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) version of the aircraft. Those models can operate from small islands skirting the East China Sea or from ships such as the Izumo-class helicopter carriers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have not yet made any plan and we are evaluating what fighter aircraft we need,” Itsunori Onodera said at a news briefing on Tuesday when asked whether Japan planned to buy more F-35s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Onodera’s ministry will release two defense reviews by the end of the year that will outline Japan’s security goals and military procurement plans for the five years beginning in April 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first of the 42 F-35As ordered by Japan’s Air Self Defence Force (ASDF) are being deployed to Misawa Air Base in northern Japan. Japanese government officials and Lockheed Martin executives are set to attend a ceremony there on Saturday to mark the entry of the first Japanese F-35 into service.\n",
      "\n",
      "The F-35 accounts for about a quarter of Lockheed Martin’s total revenue. The company is hiring 1,800 workers for its Fort Worth, Texas, factory to build a fleet that is expected to grow to more than 3,000 jets worldwide. Lockheed Martin is scheduled to nearly triple annual production to more than 160 jets by 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first Japanese F-35s will replace aging F-4 Phantom fighters that date back to 1960s. The next batch will allow Japan to retire some of the aging 200 F-15s flown by the ASDF that are the main interceptor workhorse of the nation’s air defenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Japan also wants to build its own stealth fighter, dubbed the F-3, although the high cost of military aircraft development means it will probably need to find foreign partners to share the expense.\n",

      "While we have a number of treatments available for clinical depression, many of them have a significant side effects, and a lot of people struggle to find a drug that they respond to. The situation is made worse by our limited understanding of the biology underlying depression. We don't know how to create targeted drugs, so most of the available treatments are blunt instruments that can take weeks to months before having an effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that light, it came as a bit of a shock when we discovered a drug we'd been using recreationally and for anesthesia could lift the symptoms of depression in less than 24 hours. Unfortunately, the drug in question, ketamine, also has a collection of unpleasant side-effects, and we had no idea how it was working.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there's been significant progress in unravelling the confusion over ketamine, with researchers identifying a ketamine derivative that tackles depression with far fewer side effects. And this week, a team of researchers at China's Zhejiang University announced that they've figured out where in the brain ketamine acts when it blocks depression, a finding that gives us significant insights into the biology of the disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ketamine and depression\n",
      "\n",
      "The new studies rely on the work of a number of other labs, which have identified a specific structure deep in the brain that's associated with depression. Called the lateral habenula, it's been associated with a variety of activities, the most relevant of which seems to be the processing of unpleasant outcomes and punishment. Electrodes implanted there have been used to relieve depression in at least one instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "To test whether this might be the site of ketamine's activity, one team of researchers infused the drug directly into the lateral habenula of rats with depression-like symptoms; it blocked them. So did a separate chemical that inhibits the same proteins that ketamine acts on. Tracking the activity in the area, the researchers were able to show that there are bursts of activity in rats with symptoms of depression that are absent in healthy rats. The drugs that blocked depression suppressed these bursts.\n",
      "\n",
      "To confirm that was really causal, the researchers performed the converse experiment, engineering cells in the lateral habenula to emit bursts of activity in response to light. This showed that the bursts themselves were enough to drive depressive symptoms in these animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second paper, produced by many of the same researchers, describes what's going on at the cellular level in the habenula. In this work the team induced depression in rats either chemically or by inducing what's called \"learned helplessness.\" (The latter involves training the rats to recognize that they have no control over negative consequences in their environment.) The team then obtained tissue samples from the lateral habenula and examined every single protein produced there, looking for differences between depressed and healthy animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ion flow\n",
      "\n",
      "The most interesting result to come out of this was a protein that controls the flow of ions between a cell and its environment. That's not much of a surprise, given that nerve impulses are driven by the exchange of ions across a nerve cell's membrane. But the protein identified here isn't made by nerve cells. Instead, it's made by a type of cell called an astrocyte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Astrocytes were once thought to be merely support cells that helped provide a good environment for nerve cells. But we've developed a significant body of evidence that hints that they may be involved in signaling with nerves as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of depression, it doesn't seem that direct signaling is involved. Instead, it's involved in the process of resetting the nerve cell after an impulse, which requires gathering back all the ions that flowed out of the cell during the impulse. By changing the amount of potassium available to the nerve cell, the protein identified by this team alters the ease with which a nerve cell can fire again. By increasing the dose of this gene, the researchers were able to induce depression-like symptoms in mice; knocking the gene down reduced their ability to induce depressive behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of this is to say that this team has found a \"cause of depression\" or something similar. Depression is a complicated disorder, and it's unlikely that there's going to be a single underlying cause. What they have found, however, is something that's likely to be central to the generation of the symptoms we associate with the disorder. Excess activity of a brain region thought to be involved in processing negative rewards makes a lot of sense as a trigger for the symptoms of depression, while the protein identified here makes sense as a trigger for this excess activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as critically, the work shows that drugs are able to disrupt this process. We're still at the point where these drugs have significant side effects, but we now know a bit about what their targets are doing and where they have to act. That will hopefully lead to something a bit more specific before too long.\n",

This meant that people or organizations could grow their internet presence knowing the rules of the game wouldn’t change later on. Huge web properties were started during this era including Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube. In the process, the importance of centralized platforms like AOL greatly diminished.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the second era of the internet, from the mid 2000s to the present, for-profit tech companies — most notably Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (GAFA) — built software and services that rapidly outpaced the capabilities of open protocols. The explosive growth of smartphones accelerated this trend as mobile apps became the majority of internet use. Eventually users migrated from open services to these more sophisticated, centralized services. Even when users still accessed open protocols like the web, they would typically do so mediated by GAFA software and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that billions of people got access to amazing technologies, many of which were free to use. The bad news is that it became much harder for startups, creators, and other groups to grow their internet presence without worrying about centralized platforms changing the rules on them, taking away their audiences and profits. This in turn stifled innovation, making the internet less interesting and dynamic. Centralization has also created broader societal tensions, which we see in the debates over subjects like fake news, state sponsored bots, “no platforming” of users, EU privacy laws, and algorithmic biases. These debates will only intensify in the coming years.\n",

      "“Web 3” — the third era of the internet\n",
      "\n",
      "One response to this centralization is to impose government regulation on large internet companies. This response assumes that the internet is similar to past communication networks like the phone, radio, and TV networks. But the hardware-based networks of the past are fundamentally different than the internet, a software-based network. Once hardware-based networks are built, they are nearly impossible to rearchitect. Software-based networks can be rearchitected through entrepreneurial innovation and market forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "The internet is the ultimate software-based network, consisting of a relatively simple core layer connecting billions of fully programmable computers at the edge. Software is simply the encoding of human thought, and as such has an almost unbounded design space. Computers connected to the internet are, by and large, free to run whatever software their owners choose. Whatever can be dreamt up, with the right set of incentives, can quickly propagate across the internet. Internet architecture is where technical creativity and incentive design intersect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The internet is still early in its evolution: the core internet services will likely be almost entirely rearchitected in the coming decades. This will be enabled by crypto-economic networks, a generalization of the ideas first introduced in Bitcoin and further developed in Ethereum. Cryptonetworks combine the best features of the first two internet eras: community-governed, decentralized networks with capabilities that will eventually exceed those of the most advanced centralized services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why decentralization?\n",
      "\n",
      "Decentralization is a commonly misunderstood concept. For example, it is sometimes said that the reason cryptonetwork advocates favor decentralization is to resist government censorship, or because of libertarian political views. These are not the main reasons decentralization is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s look at the problems with centralized platforms. Centralized platforms follow a predictable life cycle. When they start out, they do everything they can to recruit users and 3rd-party complements like developers, businesses, and media organizations. They do this to make their services more valuable, as platforms (by definition) are systems with multi-sided network effects. As platforms move up the adoption S-curve, their power over users and 3rd parties steadily grows.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they hit the top of the S-curve, their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. The easiest way to continue growing lies in extracting data from users and competing with complements over audiences and profits. Historical examples of this are Microsoft vs Netscape, Google vs Yelp, Facebook vs Zynga, and Twitter vs its 3rd-party clients. Operating systems like iOS and Android have behaved better, although still take a healthy 30% tax, reject apps for seemingly arbitrary reasons, and subsume the functionality of 3rd-party apps at will.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 3rd parties, this transition from cooperation to competition feels like a bait-and-switch. Over time, the best entrepreneurs, developers, and investors have become wary of building on top of centralized platforms. We now have decades of evidence that doing so will end in disappointment. In addition, users give up privacy, control of their data, and become vulnerable to security breaches. These problems with centralized platforms will likely become even more pronounced in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enter cryptonetworks\n",
      "\n",
      "Cryptonetworks are networks built on top of the internet that 1) use consensus mechanisms such as blockchains to maintain and update state, 2) use cryptocurrencies (coins/tokens) to incentivize consensus participants (miners/validators) and other network participants. Some cryptonetworks, such as Ethereum, are general programming platforms that can be used for almost any purpose. Other cryptonetworks are special purpose, for example Bitcoin is intended primarily for storing value, Golem for performing computations, and Filecoin for decentralized file storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early internet protocols were technical specifications created by working groups or non-profit organizations that relied on the alignment of interests in the internet community to gain adoption. This method worked well during the very early stages of the internet but since the early 1990s very few new protocols have gained widespread adoption. Cryptonetworks fix these problems by providing economics incentives to developers, maintainers, and other network participants in the form of tokens. They are also much more technically robust. For example, they are able to keep state and do arbitrary transformations on that state, something past protocols could never do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cryptonetworks use multiple mechanisms to ensure that they stay neutral as they grow, preventing the bait-and-switch of centralized platforms. First, the contract between cryptonetworks and their participants is enforced in open source code. Second, they are kept in check through mechanisms for “voice” and “exit.” Participants are given voice through community governance, both “on chain” (via the protocol) and “off chain” (via the social structures around the protocol). Participants can exit either by leaving the network and selling their coins, or in the extreme case by forking the protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, cryptonetworks align network participants to work together toward a common goal — the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This alignment is one of the main reasons Bitcoin continues to defy skeptics and flourish, even while new cryptonetworks like Ethereum have grown alongside it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today’s cryptonetworks suffer from limitations that keep them from seriously challenging centralized incumbents. The most severe limitations are around performance and scalability. The next few years will be about fixing these limitations and building networks that form the infrastructure layer of the crypto stack. After that, most of the energy will turn to building applications on top of that infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "How decentralization wins\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s one thing to say decentralized networks should win, and another thing to say they will win. Let’s look at specific reasons to be optimistic about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software and web services are built by developers. There are millions of highly skilled developers in the world. Only a small fraction work at large technology companies, and only a small fraction of those work on new product development. Many of the most important software projects in history were created by startups or by communities of independent developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.” — Bill Joy\n",
      "\n",
      "Decentralized networks can win the third era of the internet for the same reason they won the first era: by winning the hearts and minds of entrepreneurs and developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "An illustrative analogy is the rivalry in the 2000s between Wikipedia and its centralized competitors like Encarta. If you compared the two products in the early 2000s, Encarta was a far better product, with better topic coverage and higher accuracy. But Wikipedia improved at a much faster rate, because it had an active community of volunteer contributors who were attracted to its decentralized, community-governed ethos. By 2005, Wikipedia was the most popular reference site on the internet. Encarta was shut down in 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lesson is that when you compare centralized and decentralized systems you need to consider them dynamically, as processes, instead of statically, as rigid products. Centralized systems often start out fully baked, but only get better at the rate at which employees at the sponsoring company improve them. Decentralized systems start out half-baked but, under the right conditions, grow exponentially as they attract new contributors.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of cryptonetworks, there are multiple, compounding feedback loops involving developers of the core protocol, developers of complementary cryptonetworks, developers of 3rd party applications, and service providers who operate the network. These feedback loops are further amplified by the incentives of the associated token, which — as we’ve seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum — can supercharge the rate at which crypto communities develop (and sometimes lead to negative outcomes, as with the excessive electricity consumed by Bitcoin mining).\n",
      "\n",
      "The question of whether decentralized or centralized systems will win the next era of the internet reduces to who will build the most compelling products, which in turn reduces to who will get more high quality developers and entrepreneurs on their side. GAFA has many advantages, including cash reserves, large user bases, and operational infrastructure. Cryptonetworks have a significantly more attractive value proposition to developers and entrepreneurs. If they can win their hearts and minds, they can mobilize far more resources than GAFA, and rapidly outpace their product development.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you asked people in 1989 what they needed to make their life better, it was unlikely that they would have said a decentralized network of information nodes that are linked using hypertext.” — Farmer & Farmer\n",
      "\n",
      "Centralized platforms often come bundled at launch with compelling apps: Facebook had its core socializing features and the iPhone had a number of key apps. Decentralized platforms, by contrast, often launch half-baked and without clear use cases. As a result, they need to go through two phases of product-market fit: 1) product-market fit between the platform and the developers/entrepreneurs who will finish the platform and build out the ecosystem, and 2) product-market fit between the platform/ecosystem and end users. This two-stage process is what causes many people — including sophisticated technologists — to consistently underestimate the potential of decentralized platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next era of the internet\n",
      "\n",
      "Decentralized networks aren’t a silver bullet that will fix all the problems on the internet. But they offer a much better approach than centralized systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compare the problem of Twitter spam to the problem of email spam. Since Twitter closed their network to 3rd-party developers, the only company working on Twitter spam has been Twitter itself. By contrast, there were hundreds of companies that tried to fight email spam, financed by billions of dollars in venture capital and corporate funding. Email spam isn’t solved, but it’s a lot better now, because 3rd parties knew that the email protocol was decentralized, so they could build businesses on top of it without worrying about the rules of the game changing later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or consider the problem of network governance. Today, unaccountable groups of employees at large platforms decide how information gets ranked and filtered, which users get promoted and which get banned, and other important governance decisions. In cryptonetworks, these decisions are made by the community, using open and transparent mechanisms. As we know from the offline world, democratic systems aren’t perfect, but they are a lot better than the alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Centralized platforms have been dominant for so long that many people have forgotten there is a better way to build internet services. Cryptonetworks are a powerful way to develop community-owned networks and provide a level playing field for 3rd-party developers, creators, and businesses. We saw the value of decentralized systems in the first era of the internet. Hopefully we’ll get to see it again in the next.\n",

      "Meanwhile, in Algeria, 41 percent of college graduates in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math—or “STEM,” as it’s known—are female. There, employment discrimination against women is rife and women are often pressured to make amends with their abusive husbands.\n",

      "According to a report I covered a few years ago, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates were the only three countries in which boys are significantly less likely to feel comfortable working on math problems than girls are. In all of the other nations surveyed, girls were more likely to say they feel “helpless while performing a math problem.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So what explains the tendency for nations that have traditionally less gender equality to have more women in science and technology than their gender-progressive counterparts do?\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a new paper published in Psychological Science by the psychologists Gijsbert Stoet, at Leeds Beckett University, and David Geary, at the University of Missouri, it could have to do with the fact that women in countries with higher gender inequality are simply seeking the clearest possible path to financial freedom. And often, that path leads through STEM professions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue doesn’t appear to be girls’ aptitude for STEM professions. In looking at test scores across 67 countries and regions, Stoet and Geary found that girls performed about as well or better than boys did on science in most countries, and in almost all countries, girls would have been capable of college-level science and math classes if they had enrolled in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when it comes to their relative strengths, in almost all the countries—all except Romania and Lebanon—boys’ best subject was science, and girls’ was reading. (That is, even if an average girl was as good as an average boy at science, she was still likely to be even better at reading.) Across all countries, 24 percent of girls had science as their best subject, 25 percent of girls’ strength was math, and 51 percent excelled in reading. For boys, the percentages were 38 for science, 42 for math, and 20 for reading. And the more gender-equal the country, as measured by the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index, the larger this gap between boys and girls in having science as their best subject. (The most gender-equal countries are the typical snowy utopias you hear about, like Sweden, Finland, and Iceland. Turkey and the United Arab Emirates rank among the least equal, according to the Global Gender Gap Index.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The gap in reading “is related at least in part to girls’ advantages in basic language abilities and a generally greater interest in reading; they read more and thus practice more,” Geary told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s more, the countries that minted the most female college graduates in fields like science, engineering, or math were also some of the least gender-equal countries. They posit that this is because the countries that empower women also empower them, indirectly, to pick whatever career they’d enjoy most and be best at.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Countries with the highest gender equality tend to be welfare states,” they write, “with a high level of social security.” Meanwhile, less gender-equal countries tend to also have less social support for people who, for example, find themselves unemployed. Thus, the authors suggest, girls in those countries might be more inclined to choose STEM professions, since they offer a more certain financial future than, say, painting or writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the study authors looked at the “overall life satisfaction” rating of each country—a measure of economic opportunity and hardship—they found that gender-equal countries had more life satisfaction. The life-satisfaction ranking explained 35 percent of the variation between gender equality and women’s participation in STEM. That correlation echoes past research showing that the genders are actually more segregated by field of study in more economically developed places.\n",
      "\n",
      "The upshot of this research is neither especially feminist nor especially sad: It’s not that gender equality discourages girls from pursuing science. It’s that it allows them not to if they’re not interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "The findings will likely seem controversial, since the idea that men and women have different inherent abilities is often used as a reason, by some, to argue we should forget trying to recruit more women into the STEM fields. But, as the University of Wisconsin gender-studies professor Janet Shibley Hyde, who wasn’t involved with the study, put it to me, that’s not quite what’s happening here.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some would say that the gender STEM gap occurs not because girls can’t do science, but because they have other alternatives, based on their strengths in verbal skills,” she said. “In wealthy nations, they believe that they have the freedom to pursue those alternatives and not worry so much that they pay less.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, this line of research, if it’s replicated, might hold useful takeaways for people who do want to see more Western women entering STEM fields. In this study, the percentage of girls who did excel in science or math was still larger than the number of women who were graduating with STEM degrees. That means there’s something in even the most liberal societies that’s nudging women away from math and science, even when those are their best subjects. The women-in-STEM advocates could, for starters, focus their efforts on those would-be STEM stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then again, it could just be that, feeling financially secure and on equal footing with men, some women will always choose to follow their passions, rather than whatever labor economists recommend. And those passions don’t always lie within science.\n",

      "Milwaukee Bucks head coach Jason Kidd went to a different sport when looking for comparisons for Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is the [Mike] Tyson of basketball,\" Kidd said before his team's game against the Thunder on Tuesday, per Nick Friedell of ESPN.com. \"When the jump ball [goes up], he is coming as Tyson did [in getting] off the stool. When the bell rings, he's coming for you. Whenever he's on the floor, he plays at one speed, and that's fast and hard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kidd saw only one current point guard who could be in the same category as Westbrook speed-wise: \"He's a little different in that case that he's probably the only one and then I would put [at] 1B in that same category, John Wall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bucks coach also had experience facing Westbrook during his playing days and understands how daunting the Thunder point guard can be in the open floor. He went as far as to compare this year's Oklahoma City team to the \"older Miami teams...where live-ball turnovers turn into dunks or threes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Those Heat teams had a Big Three with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, and this season's Thunder squad has Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony and Paul George.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the presence of the other two stars means Westbrook no longer has to carry the team on his shoulders throughout entire games and average a triple-double for the season, he hasn't slowed much with 20.8 points, 12.2 assists and 9.8 rebounds per night through the first six games of the season.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 12.2 assists would mark a career high if he maintains that pace, although the approach has led to mixed results, as the Thunder only have a 3-3 record.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Thunder likely need some time to gel following so much significant roster turnover this offseason, but as long as they have the Tyson-like speed of Westbrook leading the way, they remain a threat in the Western Conference.\n",

      "Jahlil Okafor told reporters Wednesday he would like to facilitate a move out of Philadelphia—whether it's through a buyout or a trade—and an Atlantic Division rival has reportedly already cropped up as a potential landing spot for the disgruntled center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Citing league sources, the Philadelphia Inquirer's Keith Pompey reported the Boston Celtics \"have expressed the most interest in Okafor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Pompey noted the Celtics \"aren't willing to give up much\" in a swap after the Sixers indicated Okafor isn't in their long-term plans when they declined his fourth-year option Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Honestly, I didn't want them to pick up my option,\" Okafor said Wednesday, according to NBC Sports Philadelphia's Jessica Camerato. \"I've been going through a lot since I've been here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Okafor also disclosed general manager Bryan Colangelo is not keen on a buyout, since he wants to receive something in return for the 2015 No. 3 overall pick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bryan didn't think [a buyout] would be a great idea because he said he would be giving me away to a team for free,\" Okafor said, per Pompey. \"But that's pretty much where we stand right now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical confirmed the sentiment surrounding buying out Okafor:\n",
      "\n",
      "With a buyout seemingly off the table for now, the Sixers figure to scan the trade market more as they hope to extract a few pennies on the dollar for a player who was once tabbed as a potential franchise cornerstone.\n",

      "Okafor, meanwhile, will continue to be glued to the bench after head coach Brett Brown told reporters Amir Johnson is entrenched as the backup to Joel Embiid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm playing Amir (Johnson) ahead of him and that's just the situation,\" Brown said Oct. 27, per NBC Sports Philadelphia's Matt Bowker. \"[Okafor] doesn't let people know. He comes in and his head's good and his spirit's good. And he and I talk all the time, but that is the bottom line. He is not in the rotation.\"\n",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Houston Astros are all alone in the baseball stratosphere, coming through just when their city needed them most.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a little more than two months ago, the Astros were displaced, disconsolate and helpless, grieving that they could not do more for a city ravaged by Hurricane Harvey and its aftermath. All the Astros could do then was play baseball, to give their fans common cause and a little distraction.\n",

      "All they can do now is revel in the first World Series title in the history of both the city and the state. It seems like so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our team believed in each other all year,\" World Series MVP George Springer said. \"And through the good times and the bad times, through a rough stretch in August, to getting down 3-2 against a very good New York team [in the American League Championship Series], there's a lot of things that happened. I'm so happy to be a part of it to bring a championship back to a city that desperately needed one. It is a surreal feeling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of the most dramatic World Series ever, the Astros sucked the air out of Dodger Stadium from the outset. They jumped on Los Angeles Dodgers starter Yu Darvish for five early runs and then cruised to a 5-1 clincher on Wednesday, the first World Series Game 7 at Dodger Stadium.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he has done so many times during his spectacular young career, Springer sparked it all, leading off the game with a double and scoring on Cody Bellinger's throwing error. Then he broke the game open in the second inning with a cometlike homer to left-center that gave Houston a five-run lead. No team had ever overcome a deficit that large in a winner-take-all World Series game. Lance McCullers Jr. and the bullpen -- led by a heroic four-inning effort from Charlie Morton to finish the game -- made sure that stat remained in effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When the stage got big and the anxiousness started, you just rely on your guys,\" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \"George, as [the leadoff hitter], when he goes, we all go. And I think that was seen the rest of the Series; when he got going, it gets pretty scary. He can do a ton of damage. He's at the top of the lineup for a reason.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "George Springer celebrates hitting his fifth home run of the World Series to help deliver Houston's Game 7 win. David J. Phillip/AP Photo\n",
      "\n",
      "Springer became the first player with homers in four straight games in one World Series. He tied Reggie Jackson (1977) and current Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley (2009) with five homers in one Fall Classic. He also set a new World Series mark with 29 total bases. All this after his rough start in the Series led to some in the media worrying if his swing had gone wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly not. After the game, Springer was crowned World Series MVP -- an award now named after Willie Mays, another center fielder, whom Springer used to imitate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I used to go in the backyard with my dad and he would hit me fly balls and I'd pretend to be him,\" Springer said. \"I would pretend to be Willie Mays. And to earn this is great. It's an honor. But it's not about me. It's about the team and what the team has done tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost all the young Astros' stars contributed to their historic win. Alex Bregman scored a run and made a couple of nifty defensive plays. Jose Altuve drove in a run on a groundout. McCullers pitched around some early command troubles -- he hit a postseason record four batters -- and drove in a run at the plate. Carlos Correa singled off of Clayton Kershaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus completes the rapid rise of a franchise only three years removed from the third of three straight 100-loss seasons, one of the worst trios of campaigns any franchise has ever had. Houston becomes the fourth team to go from 100 losses to a title within five seasons, joining last year's Chicago Cubs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with the losses came draft picks, international signings, upgraded developmental processes -- all conducted under the cutting-edge baseball operations machine headed up by general manager Jeff Luhnow and put into action under Hinch.\n",
      "\n",
      "But suffice to say, the Astros are all grown up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lone Star State has its first World Series champion, as the Astros climb to the top of the baseball world for the first time in their 56 years of existence. When you add in the Texas Rangers' 46 years without a title, the combined drought was even longer than the one the Cubs broke last season. But in the end, the Astros got there before the Rangers, and in a spirited intrastate rivalry, that means a lot too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The folks in Houston continue to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of the city and surrounding areas with record flooding at the end of August. They'll be dealing with it for a long time to come. The storm forced the Astros to relocate a three-game series against the Rangers to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. The players, some with families stranded by the catastrophe, struggled to focus on the games at hand and let it be known they wanted to get home as soon possible to do what they could to help the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell a quick story about Jose, who was separated from his family. A lot of guys, a lot of our families, some were with us, some weren't,\" Hinch said. \"Jose came up to me and asked how long he would have to play like this, with his family back in Houston, getting surrounded by water.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They were safe but scared. It's not easy to ask your players, 'Jose, now, go out and get your normal two and three hits. Be the 3-hole hitter. Play hard. And deliver us a win.’ And we did. We won a couple of games along that stretch. But if you want to humanize baseball, look at that story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sylvester Turner, mayor of Houston, was adamant that a return by the Astros would be a big step toward a return to normalcy, so the Astros returned to Minute Maid Park two days after the side trip to St. Petersburg. Hinch addressed the fans before the first game back, saying, \"Hello, Houston. It's good to be home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Astros fans cheer at the Game 7 watch party back in Houston. Bob Levey/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "After a torrid first half of the season, the Astros also had been in a funk on the field, with injuries to several pitchers and star shortstop Correa. But things started turning around even before the end of the homecoming series, just one week after Harvey.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's because Justin Verlander joined the Astros that weekend, acquired by the team from the Detroit Tigers seconds before the Aug. 31 trade deadline. Verlander's presence boosted the Astros down the stretch as they recorded 101 regular-season wins, and he played a crucial role in the postseason with his ALCS MVP performance against the Yankees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verlander was the final piece for a team that had constructed baseball's most dynamic core of young offensive talent. It was a piece the Astros needed, because the margin between them and the Dodgers was razor-thin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This was a great Series between two 100-win teams, two great teams, two great offenses, two great defenses, two great pitching staffs and two great pens,\" Springer said. \"The wildness of this Series, the wackiness of this Series, the emotional ups and downs, being able to play in this is something that I will never, ever forget. Even if this is the only time I will ever get here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And that's a good team over there. I don't expect them to go anywhere anytime soon. I'd expect them to be competing for a world championship for years to come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The champion Astros began to form in 2010, when Jim Crane purchased the team from Drayton McLane and agreed to allow Major League Baseball to move the team to the American League West. Then Luhnow took over in 2011 and modernized the organization, while committing to a total rebuild from the bottom up.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we do mean bottom. From 2011 to 2013, the Astros lost 324 games. The only teams to lose that many over a three-year span were the 1962-64 New York Mets and the 1915-17 Philadelphia Athletics, a victim of Connie Mack's decision to sell off all the useful parts from his 1914 AL pennant winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Altuve was first called up to the majors in 2011 to join the first of those 100-loss teams. He, more than anyone, can appreciate how the Astros grew into champions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believed in what Jeff Luhnow and Jim Crane used to talk to me, 'Hey, we're going to be good. We're going to be good,’\" Altuve said. \"Then OK, let me keep working hard. Let me get better every year and try to be part of the winning team. I always believed that we're going to become good. Then I saw Springer get drafted, Correa and Bregman, and I was like, 'OK, here we go.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By 2015, the Astros' reconstruction efforts had them back in the postseason. But that run only added to a franchise legacy for postseason near misses -- dating through the years of Nolan Ryan and Mike Scott in the 1980s and the Killer B's era of Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell in the 1990s and early 2000s. The 2015 Astros' five-game loss to the Kansas City Royals in the AL Division Series included a squandered 6-2 lead in Game 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "That history would have added a new chapter had Houston dropped Game 7. Instead, those old books can be chucked into Buffalo Bayou. This team has come a long way in 56 years. Heck, they’ve come a long way in two months.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The baseball was important,\" Hinch said. \"We were chasing the pennant. This is a team that wanted to win the division. We'd been knocked out of the division a couple of years in a row. But we never lost perspective of what was important.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw these guys at the community center the day off that the Mets gave us on Friday night [after our return to Houston]. I saw these guys do good deeds for people as they started to rebuild the city. And I think that's why the city fell in love with this team all over again. That’s why we had that Houston Strong strength that carried us a long way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no shortcuts. There was plenty of pain, and maybe a few too many losses. But who could argue now whether it was worth it? Well, maybe a few Rangers fans, but that's about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This year in spring training I realized this is the team,\" Altuve said. \"It's something in our clubhouse, a lot of chemistry, good relationships between players, coaches, with everybody. I was like, OK, I believed it was the year. Everybody did it, and now we're here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This group has grown from historically bad to historically good. The city around the team has grown into the nation's fourth largest and is projected to soon surpass Chicago for No. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "That weekend two months ago, when the Astros returned home, their downtown neighborhood looked no worse for the wear. The flooding had not been bad in that district, and there were only hints of storm damage here and there. But one thing served as a stark reminder that the city was in distress and that beyond downtown, many were suffering: There were almost no people around, save for those who had sought shelter at the local convention center.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scene could not have been more different last week when Houston played host to Games 3, 4 and 5 -- the last the classic 13-12 victory that cemented this World Series' status as an all-timer. The streets were alive with orange-wearing fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few days later, as the Astros celebrated in the bowels of Dodger Stadium, those streets remained alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for the first time in the state of Texas, they are dancing to the beat of a brand-new baseball champion.\n",

      "Mike Leslie of WFAA described the play and how effectively TCU's return unit blocked for Turpin:\n",
      "\n",
      "This season, Turpin has been a do-everything weapon on offense and special teams, and he joined some impressive company over the past decade with the kickoff-return score, per ESPN Stats and Info:\n",

      "Hill had a rough afternoon overall with 135 passing yards, no touchdowns, two picks and one fumble lost.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Cyclones find themselves tied atop the Big 12 with TCU and Oklahoma State at 4-1, but they have tough matchups on the horizon over the next two weeks with No. 22 West Virginia and No. 11 Oklahoma State.\n",

      "New England got its lone touchdown via a 2-yard toss from Brady to Rob Gronkowski in the second quarter. The Patriots went 1 for 4 in the red zone, but were able to cobble together the Gostkowki field goals and a safety.\n",

      "The Chargers cut the Patriots' lead to 18-13 with 8:30 to play following a 24-yard touchdown pass from Philip Rivers to Travis Benjamin and failed 2-point conversion pass.

      "\n",
      "Down 38-34 with 1:39 left and out of timeouts, Wilson took Seattle 80 yards in barely a minute. He hit Paul Richardson for 48 yards on a jump ball to start the drive, found Tyler Lockett for 19 yards, and drilled a strike to Graham for the winner.\n",

      "\n",
      "It was a stunning performance by Watson against one of the best defenses in the NFL -- and an even better final rally by Wilson. Watson threw touchdown passes of 59 and 20 yards to Will Fuller, 2 yards to Lamar Miller, and a wide receiver screen that DeAndre Hopkins took 72 yards for a score with 5:01 left to give Houston a 38-34 lead.\n",

      "\n",

      "But if there was concern the discussion about a protest would distract the Texans, it was put to rest almost immediately. Watson and Fuller connected on the first of their two TDs on Houston's opening drive, igniting an unexpected shootout between the quarterbacks.\n",

      "The plan involved a covert political operative who worked with Putin, a double amputee, a settlement with Texas A&M, and—ultimately—a failed bid that opened up the opportunity for Donald Trump's presidential run.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Donald Trump finds new ways to drag out his vicious feud with the National Football League— he tweeted Monday morning that there's \"no leadership in the NFL\"—a big question looms about where this all began. Could it be, as several reports now suggest, that this whole national trauma can be traced back to Trump's failed attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills back in 2014?\n",
      "\n",
      "That's what some team owners have reportedly said, contending that the president is driven by a personal grudge stemming from his multiple doomed efforts over the decades to become the owner of an NFL franchise. Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan told USA Today that Trump is \"jealous\" of the league and its owners, having failed to become one. \"He's been elected President, where maybe a great goal he had in life—to own an NFL team—is not very likely,\" Khan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, come on, how badly did Trump really want to buy the Bills? Badly enough, it seems, to create a dubious grassroots campaign to pressure the team and the league to not sell to a rival group of bidders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in early 2014, with the team for sale and potential buyers in the process of being narrowed to three finalists—Trump, Buffalo Sabres owner Terry Pegula, and a group of Toronto investors led by Jon Bon Jovi—speculation was rampant that the would-be Canadian buyers planned to move the franchise north of the border. That's when a local fan group sprang up, hoping to turn sentiment in Buffalo against Bon Jovi and his partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "These activist Bills backers called themselves \"12th Man Thunder\" and began orchestrating colorful stunts like establishing \"Bon Jovi-Free Zones\" in local bars, antics that earned them ink everywhere from Breitbart to New York magazine. (All that attention also got them into a legal showdown with Texas A&M over the use of the phrase \"12th man,\" which the Aggies had trademarked.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But what almost nobody knew—until now—is that the whole thing was pulled together by the then-future president of the United States. In the spring of 2014, Trump hired veteran Republican operative and Buffalo resident Michael Caputo—a close associate of Paul Manafort and Roger Stone. Caputo had worked with Ollie North during the Reagan years and then helped boost the careers of Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin as a political consultant in Russia—now he was enlisted to create a group that would scuttle Bon Jovi's NFL chances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trump knew he couldn't outbid the Canadians,\" Caputo recounted to me recently. Instead, Caputo explained, he would scare them off by turning Buffalo against them. Two days after we spoke, the president took the stage at a political rally in Alabama and began his smoldering feud with the NFL by calling any player who showed the temerity to kneel during the national anthem a \"son of a bitch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Having been publicly involved with abortive efforts to launch Trump into New York's gubernatorial race the year before, Caputo was too closely associated with the mogul to be the public face of the 2014 effort, so he recruited others. \"I had it all set up with neighborhood guys who lived by the stadium,\" he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We weren't even allowed to mention [Trump's] name because of the agreement that he signed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a stroke of cunning, Caputo recruited Chuck Sonntag, a double amputee cancer survivor, to serve as the group's leader. Press coverage would occasionally identify Caputo as a \"PR consultant\" to the group, while reporting that it was founded by Sonntag as he lay recovering from his amputations in a rehabilitation center. \"It was easier for Sonntag to lose his leg than his team,\" Caputo recalled.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Astroturfing like this—covertly funding a supposedly grassroots group—was not a new tactic for Trump and his operatives. Back in 2000, Stone and Trump's Atlantic City casino business paid massive fines after they funneled $150,000 to a group called \"the Institute for Law and Society\" to run newspaper ads opposing the legalization of a Native American casino in the Catskills and failed to disclose the transaction to New York's lobbying regulators.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump's involvement in the Buffalo scheme was short-lived. According to Caputo, not long after 12th Man Thunder was formed, Trump entered a $1 billion bid for the Bills, and as a condition of that offer, was forbidden from participating in public outreach efforts related to the sale. So, as Caputo recalls, Trump called him and told him that he had to break off contact with him and the fan group. \"I can't talk to you anymore because of the NDA I signed,\" Caputo remembers Trump saying. \"Have a good time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We immediately made it far more aggressive and anti-Toronto than the president ever envisioned, mostly because we didn't have to worry about getting him crossways with the NFL,\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlie Pellien, a Buffalo local who co-founded the group said that keeping a lid on Trump's involvement was a challenge. \"It was all behind the scenes and we weren't even allowed to mention his name because of the agreement that he signed,\" Pellien told me. \"I was bursting at the seams to tell people, 'Hey, this was Donald Trump's idea.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With Trump having removed himself from the picture, Caputo took the gloves off. \"We immediately made it far more aggressive and anti-Toronto than the president ever envisioned, mostly because we didn't have to worry about getting him crossways with the NFL,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The group gathered thousands of signatures for a petition demanding the team remain in Buffalo and started a \"Ban Bon Jovi\" movement to rid upstate New York of the New Jersey rocker's music. A local radio station, Jack FM, started playing a version of \"Livin' on a Prayer\" with new lyrics that went, \"Johnny used to get played on Jack / Now he wants our Bills / But Buffalo just won't take that / He's wack.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It generated so much noise and color that Texas A&M, which has trademarked the phrase \"12th man\" took notice and sent a cease-and-desist letter to the group over its use of the phrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unbowed, Caputo generated a raft of coverage of the dispute that amounted to: Texas A&M threatens double amputee cancer survivor with lawsuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conflict caught the notice of Keith Olbermann, who in July of that year dubbed the university's then-president, Dr. Mark A. Hussey, \"The World's Worst Person in Sports\" for taking on Sonntag. \"Screw you!\" Olbermann declared in a segment about the controversy on his eponymous ESPN show. (Olbermann is now GQ's Special Correspondent and host of \"The Resistance\")\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It changed everything,\" said Caputo, recalling that immediately after the school landed in Olbermann's crosshairs, he received a call from one of its attorneys looking to broker peace. Feeling emboldened, Caputo said he wouldn't settle with the university unless they gave money to his group, to help them keep the Bills in Buffalo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The beating continues unless they donate 25k to this organization to stop the Canadians from buying our team,\" Caputo said he told the university's attorney. Caputo said the school quickly okayed the sum and that he now wishes he had demanded $50,000 for the group. On July 30, the school and the group announced they had reached a settlement and that the group would change its name to \"Bills Fan Thunder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Representatives for the NFL and the White House did not offer comment for this story. A spokesman for Texas A&M declined to comment and instead referred me to a joint press release from the time that describes the settlement as \"amicable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With the threat of legal action out of the way, the group's campaign continued—and it worked, partially. Bon Jovi didn't get the Bills, but neither did Trump. Instead, in September 2014 the team went to Pegula, who has kept it in Buffalo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without an NFL team to run, Trump entered the presidential race nine months later, capitalizing on anti-foreigner sentiment, outrageous stunts and the enthusiasm of colorful grassroots groups to win the presidency. Caputo, Stone and Manafort each joined his presidential campaign as advisers and then left it amid various public blowups. All three have been hauled before Congress as it investigates possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caputo said Bills Fan Thunder still exists, and that it now has 20 season tickets it uses to send underprivileged youth from Buffalo, along with chaperones, to each home game. Caputo told me that after Trump launched his White House bid, he informed the candidate that the group had transformed into a vehicle for taking poor kids to Bills games. Trump, he said, seemed pleased and regularly peppered him for updates on the organization over the course of the campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Olbermann, meanwhile, has just published a book based on his GQ work critiquing the president—it is called, unsubtly, \"Donald Trump is F*cking Crazy.\" Despite their differences, Caputo places the imperatives of football over mere political disagreements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He can do whatever he wants on GQ and say whatever he wants,\" Caputo said of Olbermann. \"He'll always be a hero to me.\"\n",

      "NEW YORK -- This time, it was Masahiro Tanaka who was untouchable on the mound.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the New York Yankees sent Houston ace Dallas Keuchel to an early exit, their rollicking crowd let loose with a cathartic roar that must have boomed all over the Bronx.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"New York is no joke,\" Keuchel said afterward.\n",
      "\n",
      "One more big win, and these Yankees are World Series-bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tanaka pitched seven innings of three-hit ball and New York finally solved a longtime nemesis at just the right moment, beating Keuchel and the Astros 5-0 on Wednesday for a 3-2 lead in the AL Championship Series.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a performance,\" Yankees third baseman Todd Frazier said about Tanaka. \"Just gutsy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gary Sanchez hit an RBI single off Keuchel and later homered to help the wild-card Yankees win for the third straight day at home, moving them within one victory of their first pennant since 2009 and record 41st overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The teams head back to Houston for Game 6 on Friday night, when Justin Verlander and the reeling Astros will try to regain their footing following an off day and force a decisive Game 7. Luis Severino is scheduled to start for New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "To take the series, the Yankees knew they needed to win at least one game started by Keuchel or Verlander, both Cy Young Award winners. Now they've done that -- and they don't want to let Houston back up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't wake that sleeping dog. So we've got to just keep on rolling,\" Frazier said. \"They're going to be ready to go. We know that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Houston arrived up two games to none and appeared to be closing in on its second World Series appearance. But the Astros, like defending AL champion Cleveland before them, have been unable to put away these poised Yankees, who improved to 6-0 at home this postseason in front of their cheering, chanting fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "New York has won 19 of its past 22 games at Yankee Stadium.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's been unbelievable. I haven't seen anything like it in Major League Baseball,\" veteran Chase Headley said. \"Reminds me of college football games. They're going crazy the entire game. It's a huge advantage for us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Aaron Judge, Greg Bird and Didi Gregorius also delivered big hits as New York chased Keuchel in the fifth and handed him his first postseason loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keuchel had been Yankees kryptonite, entering 6-2 with a 1.09 ERA in eight career starts against New York -- including a pair of scoreless outings in playoff wins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of those came at the expense of Tanaka, who lost 3-0 to Keuchel in the 2015 AL wild-card game at Yankee Stadium and 2-1 in Game 1 of this series. The ace lefty with the long, bushy beard entered 4-0 with a 1.69 ERA and 31 strikeouts in 26 2/3 postseason innings overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this night belonged to Tanaka and the Baby Bombers.\n",
      "\n",
      "New York finally broke through against Keuchel with two outs in the second, when Starlin Castro doubled and scored on Greg Bird's sharp single. The sellout crowd of 49,647 almost sounded surprised by the hit -- big enough for Bird to flash both thumbs down, doubling up on the Yankees' playful sign to each other for clutch swings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The most frustrating part is the fact that I didn't pick the guys up and they were looking towards me to kind of saddle up and get this thing back going again,\" Keuchel said. \"That's a talented group over there and 1 through 9 right now the bats have woken up and it's quite a challenge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the third, Judge grounded an RBI double just inside the third base line and past a diving Alex Bregman. Brett Gardner sped all the way around from first and scored with a headfirst slide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bregman's throwing error on an infield single by Headley, who had three hits in the No. 9 spot, aided the Yankees in the fifth. Keuchel walked Judge with two outs before Sanchez lined a run-scoring single into the left-field corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going into that at-bat, Sanchez was 1 for 16 with seven strikeouts in the series -- and 0 for 8 with six strikeouts against Keuchel overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregorius then grounded an RBI single up the middle that grazed the glove of diving second baseman Jose Altuve. That ended the night for Keuchel and gave the Yankees a 4-0 cushion, the most runs he had ever allowed against them.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the stands pulsating, fans reveled in his slow walk to the dugout as the Yankee Stadium sound system blared Scandal's \"Goodbye To You.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When you play at home, things like this happen and that's why it's so tough to win on the road in the playoffs,\" Keuchel said. \"Yankee Stadium is a tough place to play and it was rockin' these three games, but it's going to be rockin' on Friday for us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanchez hit his third postseason homer off Brad Peacock in the seventh to make it 5-0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite beautiful weather in the Bronx, the Astros didn't take batting practice on the field. If they were hoping that might help their slumping hitters reset, it didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One swing and we'll be back where we need to be,\" Bregman said. \"We're going home. We've got to fight back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The highest-scoring team in the majors this season, Houston is batting .147 in the series and Tanaka is a major reason. The normally reserved right-hander from Japan, who can opt out of his $155 million contract this winter, has been at the top of his game in October and showed rare emotion on the mound during this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "He worked around a leadoff double in the second, when the Yankees -- with a stingy Keuchel undoubtedly in mind -- successfully played their infield in with Yuli Gurriel on third and one out in a scoreless game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tanaka later spun around and shouted in excitement after striking out struggling table-setters George Springer and Josh Reddick with two on to end the fifth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I love it. Those are the best guys. To see that, it gets me fired up again,\" Frazier said. \"He's been doing it all postseason. Just dominant, man. You see him out there, he talks to himself, he does all this crazy stuff and the next thing you know the ball just disappears on batters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping the ball down with his slider and splitter, Tanaka struck out eight and walked one. Tommy Kahnle tossed two innings to finish the four-hitter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tanaka also beat the Indians 1-0 in the Division Series to save the Yankees' season when they were down 0-2 in that best-of-five playoff. After going 13-12 with a 4.74 ERA during an inconsistent season, he has a 0.90 ERA in three playoff starts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel like I'm just keeping it really simple,\" Tanaka said through a translator. \"You go out there and you fight and you empty the tank.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Vest, $2,061, by Rick Owens / Tank top, $239, and shorts, $570, by Rick Owens / Sneakers, $150, by NikeLab x John Elliot GQ Cover Story LeBron James Is the Greatest Living Athlete (and Here's Why) LeBron James has been basketball's best player for the better part of 14 years. But it's his work off the court—in business, in movies, and increasingly in politics—that will define the depth of his greatness. We tailed the king from L.A. to New York to Toronto and back again, talking LeBron Inc., MJ, Cleveland, race, and the man we'd come to know simply as \"U bum.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten days before Donald Trump took on Colin Kaepernick and the NFL and Stephen Curry and the NBA, and before LeBron James, one of the most famous and popular humans in America, called the president of the United States a \"bum\" on Twitter, I asked him if he thought his adversarial stance against Trump might end up being for him what the Vietnam War was for Muhammad Ali.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" he said, \"I think only time will tell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "How so?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think Ali represented something bigger than Ali. He wanted to make a change for a future without him included. That's what Ali brought to the table. I don't know what it's like to live in every state in this country, but I know freedom. I know the opportunity that our country has given people, and to see the guy in charge now not understanding that is baffling to not only myself but to my friends and to the people that've helped grow this country. But Muhammad Ali's correlation to the war… I don't think me and Donald Trump could ever get to that point.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On the one hand, appraising the greatness of an athlete is an incredibly easy thing to do. There are seasons and statistics and big plays and rings. There are streaks and records and head-to-head matchups and end-of-season accolades. The data, the video clips, the testimonials—it's all there to compare across time. The games don't change as much as other things in society change, and so we can make strong cases, we can make cross-generational arguments, we can say things like: LeBron James is the greatest living athlete. Based on what he's done on the court thus far and what he still could potentially do in years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, an athlete's greatness can be defined more expansively. What was their influence? What did they mean? It's almost like the difference between a strict and a broad constructionist. The former looks at only what's there and says, for example: He was a top-three running back based on rushing yards and touchdowns. The latter looks at the expansiveness of the role an athlete plays in their society at a given time and asks: Who were they compared to? Who could they and should they have been? What did they do for their generation? What power did they wield, and to what effect?\n",
      "\n",
      "LeBron James is, we'd argue, a broad constructionist on the athlete-greatness front. There is LeBron James the basketball player, and he's front and center, he's still number one. But there's a deep understanding of the way this life of his is going to work for decades to come—that one day (maybe not as soon as for some other players, but still) basketball will run out, and it will be on to Phase II. Which is why he spends his off-season cramming his days laying groundwork for what comes next, expanding the universe of LeBron Inc.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s my responsibility. I believe that I was put here for a higher cause. We have people that have been in the higher positions that chose to do it and chose not to do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of a couple of weeks, I was with him as he premiered a documentary with Drake at the Toronto Film Festival, addressed crème de la crème world leaders in Midtown Manhattan, walked in a fashion show in Hell's Kitchen, and soldiered through a five-hour magazine photo shoot with ninja-military precision in L.A. (He didn't request a single thing during the shoot, not water, not food; he had one fruit snack that I offered him from my pack. It was grape.) I watched up close the ways he transformed expertly from audience to audience, modulating his clothes, and his voice, and his posture, and the way he used his hands (sometimes gesturing wildly, sometimes holding them quietly in a diamond shape at his belt buckle), and even the way he talked about the game he's galactically famous for. (I watched him oversimplify basketball to a roomful of film producers, who he safely assumed might be basketball illiterate, even describing a slam dunk as \"one of our best plays in my sport.\") He code-switched effortlessly, all depending on who was sitting across the proverbial business table from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's deadly serious about his universe of extra-basketball enterprises. And that fact right there is just one of the several arguments for his greatness. He knows the critical importance of Phase II for taking the fame, the exposure, and the influence that he has garnered and cultivated in basketball, and amplifying it to any number of ends. He knows that LeBron without Phase II is…Wilt? Russell? That is, a legacy of greatness on the court for all time, but muted by a relatively quiet life after the game. A quiet life after the game is not for LeBron James.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is why, over the years, he's spent such energy and shrewdness assembling the people around him—a Dream Team of old friends and new partners and experts in this field and that, who strategically operate within every emerging arena for him. The team is critical. The team will go a long way to priming the potential greatness of LeBron James in Phase II.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have people around me, for the most part, that've been around me for a long time,\" he told me. \"So when you've been around people for a long time, there's no sugarcoating, there's no trying to put you higher than what you should be, there's no yes-men or -women, there's no gas. It's just straight-up, raw, uncut, unfiltered knowledge, truth, passion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter how grand an athlete's ambitions outside the arena, their influence is limited if they're not exceptionally dominant in it. Despite the best ideas or the most benevolent intentions, their potential influence correlates with their talent. It just does. They can't do what LeBron James wants to do in the world if they haven't already made their case on the court. Which is, of course, why the greatness of this athlete in particular obviously starts there.\n",

      "Despite LeBron's having won just—\"just\"—four MVP awards, no player has been more consistently dominant and impactful over the past decade and a half in the NBA. And yet it's hard to see when the downturn will come. Somehow at 32 and on the verge of Season 15, he's in better shape than he was during his rookie year. (\"I feel amazing,\" he told me while getting a hand massage.) Veteran LeBron has double the muscle and seemingly none of the body fat of Rookie LeBron. He looks like an action figure—an unrealistic one at that. But you don't charge up and down the court like a freight train, guarded by every team's best and most physical defender game in and game out, 39 minutes a night, without showing a little wear and tear somewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as I could tell, he has only two physical tells that confirm his mortality. The first? His feet. Every ballplayer has busted-up, twisted feet. But the King's are exceptionally wrung out. They look like they went 12 rounds with the bear from The Revenant.\n",

It's a fact that is key to unlocking the whole recipe—the unmatched talent, yes; the unfettered intensity, sure; but more than anything, that physical consistency, the ability to just play, to stay in the game. The most high-profile player in sports can have his head busted open—during the NBA Finals, no less—and he keeps it a secret because glue will be sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to on-court greatness, LeBron beats MJ—and every other athlete—for these factors and more, and because he has the legitimate potential to play the game of basketball at the highest level longer than anyone else. Or, as he put it when I asked how he thought he could become greater than MJ in most people's eyes: \"If I was the most consistent and was at the top of the food chain more than anybody in NBA history.\" He's been to seven straight NBA Finals and could seemingly play at that level for another 10 seasons—25 total. That's astonishing. And no one has been \"the greatest\" for decades.\n",

      "Yeah, but you can't let him embarrass you out there, though.\n",

      "The Four Seasons conference room in New York was filled with producers, cameramen, and the obligatory anxiety that comes with waiting to receive a very famous person. There were basically two guys in charge in the room, one in a decent suit and one in a bad suit. Bad Suit worked for the Bloomberg Global Business Forum and explained what LeBron James was doing there: They needed \"a world leader of equal stature\" to the attendees of their upcoming summit—statesmen and businessmen like Emmanuel Macron, Justin Trudeau, Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Tim Cook, and Jack Ma (Asia's richest man). It was one of those highly exclusive gatherings where all the world's problems would either be solved or spawned. In the conference room, there were ten or so people setting up to record the greeting, a pre-taped call to action to be broadcast at the opening of the summit. \"How many world leaders are actually known around the world?\" Bad Suit said. \"We needed him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When LeBron enters a room, it feels like the floor tilts down in his direction. And this afternoon was no different. His voice carried. His hand, extraterrestrial, extended with seasoned celebrity coyness. Our necks craned up. The King smiled down, a smile as wide as his wingspan. His Lanvin shirt looked painted on. He had a pair of Nike Air Zoom Generation sneakers on his feet. He was about to address the leaders of the Free World in a pair of Nikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decent Suit ushered LeBron to his seat in front of a teleprompter and gave him directions he didn't need. \"You're representing all of us,\" he said. Meaning: people who want more from their elected and unelected leaders. LeBron politely insisted, \"I got it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After the prompter scrolled the speech a few times, LeBron gave it—a speech he was seemingly reading for the first time—a try and nailed it on the first attempt. He never hesitated or second-guessed a single word. Bad Suit's eyes filled with the same hope Morpheus's did when he found out that Neo was in fact the One. Someone in the back gasped, like out of a movie. And then, to just about every head of state and titan of industry worth a damn, 32-year-old LeBron James said, \"We know the world needs us to step up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Us.\n",
      "\n",
      "A moment like that is the most significant reason why LeBron James is the greatest living athlete. Greatness has an all-encompassing burden. It's a beauty and brains type of mandate. Floyd Mayweather could go undefeated for 50 more fights, but he'd never be the greatest living athlete. Because he's selfish. And tacky. And consequently, small. You have to transcend sport to be the greatest—beyond sneakers and drinks that replenish electrolytes and video-game covers and money teams.\n",

      "It's the Ali Test. It's a people's-champ-ness one needs. It's the ability to turn fans into followers and followers into consequential action. To be able to legitimately have an effect on the way people live in the world, as corny as it sounds. And LeBron, more than any other living athlete on earth, has that in him. The fact that he's putting over a thousand kids through college is commendable. But when assessing his imprint and the potential of his reach, it seems relatively small. Like a 30-point game. He's reaching for something bigger. Something that most athletes eschew and that LeBron himself wasn't always inclined to do. It's not like he was out there his rookie season stumping for candidates. But things have changed. It's a different world now. Which is why I figured I'd test out the upper limit of his ambition.\n",

You really don't have much 'me time.' I enjoy my 'me time.' The positive that I see from being the president… Well, not with the president we have right now, because there's no positive with him, but the positive that I've seen is being able to inspire.

Or do I now shed a light on how I can use this negative to turn into a positive, because so many people are looking for what I'm going to say. I had a conversation with my kids. I let them know this is what it is, this is how it's going to be. When it's time for y'all to fly, you'll have to understand that. When y'all go out in public and y'all start driving or y'all start moving around, be respectful to cops, as much as you can.

      "\"That's a great question. I think, um, they can love what LeBron James does. Do they know what LeBron James completely represents? I don't think so. So those people may love the way I play the game of basketball, because they might have some grandkids, you know, they might have a son or a daughter or a niece that no matter what they're talking about, the kids are like, 'LeBron is LeBron. And I don't give a damn what you talking about. I love him.' So they don't have a choice liking me. But at the end of the day, these people are gonna resort back to who they are. So do I have a definite answer to that? My state definitely voted for Donald Trump, the state that I grew up in. And I think I can sit here and say that I have a lot of fans in that state, too. It's unfortunate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The way LeBron speaks on race threads a very fine needle. It's healing and inclusive while also being extremely real. He's the anti-conformist athlete. From tweets and Instagram posts about police brutality to the way he's taken control of his career—off the court and on the court. The way he chose to leave Cleveland and then chose to come back. The way he broke the norms of free agency in the process. He's liberated every NBA player from now to eternity. But at the time, in the summer of 2010, he was bludgeoned for it—by media, by fans, and, perhaps most controversially, by Cavs owner Dan Gilbert, who published an open letter to the city of Cleveland, effectively calling LeBron a narcissist and a traitor. It had nothing to do with business or sport, for that matter. Some argued that it read like he thought he owned more than just the team—like he owned LeBron.\n",

      "\"Um, I did. I did. It was another conversation I had to have with my kids. It was unfortunate, because I believed in my heart that I had gave that city and that owner, at that point in time, everything that I had. Unfortunately, I felt like, at that point in time, as an organization, we could not bring in enough talent to help us get to what my vision was. A lot of people say they want to win, but they really don't know how hard it takes, or a lot of people don't have the vision. So, you know, I don't really like to go back on that letter, but it pops in my head a few times here, a few times there. I mean, it's just human nature. I think that had a lot to do with race at that time, too, and that was another opportunity for me to kind of just sit back and say, 'Okay, well, how can we get better? How can we get better? How can I get better?' And if it happens again, then you're able to have an even more positive outlook on it. It wasn't the notion of I wanted to do it my way. It was the notion of I'm gonna play this game, and I'm gonna prepare myself so damn hard that when I decide to do something off the court, I want to be able to do it because I've paid my dues.\"\n",

      "DALLAS (AP) — Dirk Nowitzki was ready to take the court Wednesday night – at halftime, for a ceremony in which the Mavericks star was to be presented a key to the city by Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for when the 7-foot German’s record 21st season with the same franchise will begin after a longer-than-expected recovery from ankle surgery seven months ago, Nowitzki said the goal is sometime in December.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 13-time All-Star had surgery to remove bone spurs from his left ankle just before the end of the 2017-18 season. Nowitzki was on schedule to be ready for the start of this season before a setback led to tendon soreness just before the start of training camp in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowitzki spoke alongside Rawlings before the Mavericks’ game against Brooklyn, when the ceremony was planned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s just hard when I haven’t done much for eight weeks and there’s a 40-year-old basically starting from scratch to try to get back in shape to play NBA minutes,” Nowitzki said. “Hopefully soon. Hopefully, somewhere in December I’ll be ready and the body will respond the right way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowitzki is set to become the first player to spend all 21 seasons with the same team. Until he makes his debut, he will technically share the record of 20 seasons with Kobe Bryant, who retired from the Los Angeles Lakers in 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2007 NBA MVP said he started running on a treadmill about two weeks ago and has steadily increased the intensity. Nowitzki has played in a couple of games involving staff members during practice. But until he goes through several full practices, his debut will have to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The reason why we’re taking it so slow now is once I get out there, I want to finish the rest of the season healthy,” Nowitzki said. “I don’t want to come back too soon now and then have setbacks again like I did with the Achilles a few years ago. Next thing you know I missed another few weeks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowitzki said the significance of this debut hasn’t made him any more anxious than the painstaking wait when all indications were the surgery wouldn’t affect what could – and many presume will be – his final season.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve been antsy,” he said. “Had the surgery in April and it’s been nothing but rehab and treadmills. Love to step out there soon and get the kick of competing, the crowd involved. It’s just something I miss. And once my career is over, that’s for sure something I’ll miss, the kick, the rush, the adrenaline.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowitzki said he wasn’t ready to decide how the injury will influence a decision on a possible 22nd season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either way, Rawlings didn’t want to wait past this season to honor the player who led the Mavericks to their only championship as the NBA Finals MVP in 2011 and is the highest-scoring foreign-born player in NBA history with 31,187 points, seventh on the all-time list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rawlings lauded Nowitzki for his willingness to be visible in public, mentioning that he was elected the same night Nowitzki was celebrating a birthday and they ended up at the same club.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was LIT!” Nowitzki interrupted, drawing laughs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A kid came here that was skinny and didn’t really know much about life and only lived at home,” Nowitzki said earlier. “Like I said earlier, grew into a man here. Off the court, try to help out, try to help this great city be better. Try to represent the city the right way.”\n",

      "The Pittsburgh Penguins’ banner-raising ceremony is a trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "My city’s hockey team is the best in the world, and last Wednesday night was the final celebration of back-to-back Stanley Cup wins before the puck dropped on a new season. The lights went dark at PPG Paints Arena a half-hour before game time against St. Louis, and what ensued was part EDM concert, part monster truck rally, part presidential inauguration, and part church service. It was all a monument to the franchise’s hockey greatness, and some 18,000 people were in their seats to witness it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourteen days earlier, the Penguins found themselves in the middle of another Donald Trump-engineered culture debate. Two days after Trump called protesting NFL players who kneeled during the national anthem “sons of bitches” and one day after he “withdrew” a White House invitation from Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors (after Curry had said he did not want to go), the Penguins said they’d be visiting Trump in D.C. This was briefly a big local discussion, but it was not high on the fan base’s mind last Wednesday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The front office and coaching staff were introduced first. Eventually, the camera focused on Mario Lemieux, the greatest player in franchise history and the co-owner who kept the team from financial ruin and relocation several times over. The PA guy didn’t have to announce his name for a hero’s ovation to nearly bring the roof down. The same routine followed when Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby skated out later.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am in section 209, row B that night. One section to the left, four seats in and one row down from me, there’s a guy in his late 20s in an old Ulf Samuelsson jersey. When the Penguins’ best are introduced, he stands up and bows. When Crosby’s name is announced and he emerges from the tunnel, the man throws his hands up and looks upward like he’s prayed for rain and gotten it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a weird feeling that Wednesday night. I’ve been thinking for two weeks about the Penguins’ choice to go see Trump. I’m from Mt. Lebanon, and grew up during both the Jagr-Lemieux and Crosby-Malkin eras. It bothers me that the team I care about is going to see this man at this moment. And I get it, but I don’t like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve talked to a few dozen other fans from Pittsburgh and its surrounding areas, and for the most part, they aren’t bothered at all. Many are surprised that I’d even ask about the White House on this celebratory night. That’s weird to me, given who Trump is and whom his worldview represents. Being a fan of this team used to come naturally. I find it more difficult now, but here I am, watching intently. It’s a hard feeling to reconcile.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the banner goes to the rafters, the PA announcer calls on Jeff Jimerson, a man who’s famous for exactly one thing: singing the national anthem at Penguins games. We go wild for Jeff Jimerson. As he steps onto the ice, there is no one kneeling, obviously, either in the crowd or on either the Pittsburgh or St. Louis benches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jimerson is just about to start belting out Oh Say Can You See, and my eye shifts left again to the guy in the Samuelsson sweater. He’s now standing upright, yelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hockey players fucking stand for the national anthem!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Penguins’ visit with Trump is Tuesday. It’s a normal act in an abnormal time. The team visited with Barack Obama this time a year ago and in 2009, and with George H.W. Bush after wins in the 1990s. But this visit comes at a fraught moment between the sports world and the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rooting for the Penguins has always been easy. (It’s the easiest thing I’ve ever done, since I fell in love with the Jaromir Jagr Pens in the late ‘90s.) They’re a charmed franchise that’s been blessed with transcendent talent for decades, winning five Cups in 50 seasons. Now, for the first time, caring about this team is a political choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The president and the Penguins both announced their visit on Sept. 24, right on the heels of Trump’s flaps with the NFL and the Warriors. Penguins co-owner Ron Burkle had indicated the team would go in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview in July, so this was more affirmation than unveiling. But its effect was the same. Trump immediately fell back on the Penguins to show that sports, somewhere, were still with him:\n",
      "\n",
      "Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony. Great team! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017\n",
      "\n",
      "He has since tweeted a video of the national anthem at a St. Louis Blues game, praising “19,000 RESPECTING our National Anthem.” At an Indianapolis Colts game two days before the Penguins’ visit, Vice President Mike Pence executed a planned walkout after players kneeled during the anthem. Pence painted them as anti-American.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem. — Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017\n",
      "\n",
      "The Penguins are the next athletes to be made into Trump’s props.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Penguins stand on a podium with the president, it’s possible he’ll applaud their standing for the anthem and praise hockey players in general for doing the song his way. Trump might use them to bolster his case that athletes (playing in majority-black leagues) who don’t are somehow un-American, perhaps lumping in players who don’t have the respect to visit him at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Even if Trump’s comments are tame, the Penguins will be doing him a service with their presence. They will smile behind him, completing a presidential photo op as he targets other athletes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Penguins’ role in Trump’s attack on NFL protesters or his dis-invitation of Curry seems lost on Pittsburgh. The city doesn’t spend a lot of time talking about NFL teams that aren’t the Steelers or a top AFC competitor. It spends almost no time on the NBA, which Pittsburghers regard as a more boring league than the old Big East. That Trump has chosen the Penguins to pit against the Warriors has largely not registered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re taking two leagues and putting them at odds against each other, and it’s pretty clear the dynamics of it,” said Josh Taylor, a KDKA sportscaster and weekend host on 93.7 The Fan. “You’re talking about a league that is a vast majority of African American players vs. a league that is a vast majority of all white players. And that probably didn’t really catch on with a lot of people here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In making the trip, the Penguins are insistent that they don’t mean any harm — actually, they insist that they don’t mean anything at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There appears to be a perception out there that because our organization has made a decision to accept the invitation to the White House that we have taken a stance on the issue, when the reality is it’s just the opposite,” head coach Mike Sullivan told reporters days after the visit was announced last month. “We haven’t taken any stance. The Penguins as an organization and our players have chosen not to use this platform to take a stance. There appears to be a perception that we have. It’s wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "No Penguins on the invitation list have publicly criticized the trip or said they’d avoid it. Winger Ryan Reaves was acquired in the offseason, so he wasn’t invited, but he said he’d skip the visit if he were over his personal disagreements with Trump. Former enforcer Georges Laraque called the visit an “embarrassment.” Reaves and Laraque are two of the five black players to suit up for the franchise in the last decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crosby, the captain and face of the team, echoed the organizational line.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everyone is entitled to their opinion,\" he told reporters. \"I think we've said before, this isn't us taking a stance. It's totally with the spirit of keeping politics out of it, and it's unfortunate that people want to try to twist it to become that, but it's really not, and I think that's really the truth of it all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Late in training camp, Sullivan said the Penguins would “answer questions that revolve around hockey, because that’s where our focus needs to be right now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not surprising that the Penguins think they’re in an apolitical bubble as they visit the most political person in the world. Usually, they have been in an apolitical bubble, and that’s been important, given the varied politics of this region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pittsburgh, the city, is mostly progressive — it voted 75 percent for Hillary Clinton. The rest of Allegheny County is more conservative, and you can drive 40 minutes in any direction from the city and be in deep red territory. The surrounding counties are all conservative, and the Penguins are a regional team with followings in all of them, as well as in West Virginia and Northeast Ohio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every team has fans of different political stripes, but Pittsburgh’s fan bases are probably among the most ideologically divided. Recent research by FiveThirtyEight found the Steelers’ fan base had the second closest split in the NFL between Democratic and Republican fans. I imagine the Penguins’ is similar, though their footprint isn’t as wide as the Steelers’.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, Penguins fans’ political differences haven’t surfaced. Fans poured into the old Civic Arena from the city, its wealthy suburbs, its less wealthy ex-mining communities, and all over Western Pennsylvania. They’ve done the same at the new arena, where the Penguins have played since 2010, and built up an announced sellout streak that’s closing in on 500 games. For hockey, they are a TV ratings juggernaut.\n",
      "\n",
      "When politics have animated Penguins fans in the past — at least, in the context of their hockey fandom — it’s been unifying. Not in the new, say-nothing way that we now seek “unity” in sports, but in the sense that most Penguins fans were actually on the same side. We wanted taxpayers to pay up for a new arena when the team threatened to relocate to Kansas City a decade ago, and eventually the taxpayers did. The state agreed to pay $7.5 million for 30 years, though it’s worked out to be more than that. Personally, at the time, I felt this was a fine use of government money.\n",
      "\n",
      "I talked with a few dozen fans at that Wednesday opener. Most didn’t want to discuss Trump or the Penguins’ visit with my recorder out. A significant majority of ticket-buyers I spoke to didn’t have a problem with the visit, but it’s a fool’s errand to try to quantify the fan base as feeling one way in particular. If one opinion prevailed on a truly broad scale, this discussion would be different and smaller. I thought it was notable that while people didn’t want to talk much about the trip, everyone knew about it. It’s not as if the Penguins and Trump have gone under the radar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m disappointed that they’re going. I understand why,” Candace Woods, a 25-year-old who fell in love with the team while attending nearby Washington & Jefferson College, said. She thought players were going along with an ownership diktat, which was for the best to avoid a rift. Some of her friends, she said, had sworn off the franchise as “racists, fascists, misogynists, all of it,” which Woods found an overreaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All professional athletes are just entertainers, and we’re not there to see them take one view for or another,” said Ryan Martino, who’d come in from Youngstown, Ohio, for the opener. “We’re just here to see them do their trade and their craft and make sure that they do their sport to the fullest and extreme.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One man I spoke to from the city’s South Hills, in his mid-20s, said he’d recently returned from a year abroad with the Army National Guard. He said he wouldn’t allow me to use his name because he’s now a local police officer, but he’d take any players not showing up at the White House as an act of disrespect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If they don’t go, they should all be fired,” his dad told me as we parted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wherever I ate during my few days home, I scavenged for an indication that this was a big deal. I walked laps around the concourses throughout the night and camped out in bathroom lines in a way that would’ve gotten me weird looks if anyone had noticed. I tried to find any hint that this was a discussion topic by the water cooler. It was not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People just wanna drink. They don’t wanna be aggravated,” a bartender told me on the South Side the next night, a Thursday, amid a 10-1 Blackhawks drubbing of the Penguins. He didn’t mind that I’d asked. Customers just didn’t discuss it much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The harshest criticism of the Penguins’ decision has not been local. A lot of it hasn’t even been American, with Canadian outlets taking the lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Vice Canada columnist said Crosby “had a chance to speak up for black people who play and love hockey” but sided with Trump instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another writer at The Athletic, from Montreal, criticized Lemieux over the visit. Penguins fans and some Pittsburgh media members shouted him down on Twitter in response. Lemieux is close to untouchable in this city.\n",
      "\n",
      "A panel on TSN, the Canadian ESPN, universally disagreed with taking the trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not that no one in the Pittsburgh media’s been critical or offered warnings. The Post-Gazette’s Sean Gentille warned that the Penguins should be ready to become props. Several local radio hosts have argued that the Penguins can’t be apolitical.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Pittsburgh is like a lot of places in two regards. One, it’s tribal, and the people here don’t care for it when local teams are criticized from elsewhere. There are few things they could do that wouldn’t lead us to defend them from outside criticism. Two, it prefers its sports and politics separate, no matter how impossible that is.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened that the Steelers stayed in the tunnel during the national anthem in Chicago the same weekend the Penguins-Trump news cycle started, and there’s only so much appetite for Western Pennsylvanians to grapple with the non-sports things about their sports teams all at once. The matter of the Trump visit got back-burnered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the first couple of days, it was something that really had legs to it,” Taylor said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the time the Penguins declared they’d stop talking about the White House visit, everyone else stopped, too. By the week before the Penguins were set to be used as pawns against the country’s best black athletes, the visit was no longer a topic of local conversation. And afterward, it certainly won’t be, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hockey is a bubble unto itself. It’s an expensive game to play: maybe $1,000 a year for ice fees, a few hundred bucks more to get equipment, and potentially several thousand more on travel. It’s also time-consuming. By the time I was 8 and playing hockey in the Pittsburgh suburbs, my parents were spending all that money and lugging me to 6 a.m. practices on Sundays and every Wednesday night, plus a game a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time my brother and I had finished high school, they’d spent tens of thousands of dollars on our hobby. They’d also replaced several garage door windows, knocked out by pucks. Most of the kids who grow up to play in the NHL grow up in comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of them aren’t American, but their immigration status isn’t in danger during a Trump presidency. The sport’s culture prioritizes saying only the most vanilla things and not rocking the boat. When Tampa Bay forward J.T. Brown raised his fist during the anthem on Oct. 7, he was the first NHL player to make a statement on the level of many NFL players. Hockey was never going to lead the resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hockey is among the world’s whitest sports in general, and it’s lily-white in Pittsburgh. I didn’t have a black teammate from age 5 through 17. My brother had one. The Penguins’ fan base includes people of all kinds of backgrounds, but it’s overwhelmingly white, too. Looking out at the crowd at PPG Paints Arena it’s hard to spot a fan who isn’t white.\n",
      "\n",
      "This administration’s racial politics are a matter of practicality at this point. Pittsburgh, meanwhile, is widely segregated by race and income. The result is an echo chamber of silence when fandom gets uncomfortable. Trump might use the Penguins to antagonize non-whites in sports and beyond, but the stakes for a large portion of Penguins fans — and all but one current player — are relatively small.\n",
      "\n",
      "The back-to-back Stanley Cup champions will keep selling out their building every night and racking up huge ratings. The Penguins are holy here, and their choice to visit Trump won’t cost them a significant number of fans. With about half the fan base, it’ll endear them even further. Some won’t care, and some won’t think about it. There are still people who try not to think about politics at all. Probably more than I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hate this visit because of what it means for sports teams to hang around Trump in this moment. Whether Trump takes explicit digs at the NFL while the Penguins are with him or not, their presence says it’s OK — or, at least, not that big a deal — for a president to target athletes less privileged, generally speaking, than hockey players.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump makes side-taking in this context virtually impossible, and in going, the Penguins are siding with him even as they assiduously claim they’re not. That the Penguins will stand with him and smile amid everything else he’s doing disgusts me more than anything else one of my favorite teams has ever done. And there’s a lot of competition there.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I’m angry that the Penguins are playing this part. Mad enough to swear off a childhood passion altogether? I don’t know if I can start ignoring something I’ve loved since I was 3. I would lose something fun to watch with my family and my friends, something I’ve always done.\n",
      "\n",
      "This calculation is why the Penguins had little reason not to go to the White House in the first place. I’m part of every problem I’ve just written about. Trump put stress on the bubble around Penguins fandom, but that bubble hasn't burst.\n",

      "It’s safe to say the Vegas Golden Knights are performing better than expected to start the 2017-18 season. After a week, the Golden Knights have a 3-0 record and sit at the top of the Pacific Division after a trio of incredible games to start their historic year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their performance hasn’t been flawless by any means, but it’s been held together by enough Marc-Andre Fleury saves and James Neal goals to catapult them into the national sports spotlight. Both Neal and Fleury are among the top five players in their respective roles to start out the year, and their explosive beginnings to the new season are the driving force behind Vegas’ strong opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the history of weak starts by expansion teams in the NHL, the Golden Knights are doing something quite remarkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, capped off by the viscerally emotional 5-2 win over the Arizona Coyotes in their home opener, the Golden Knights have made sports history, too. Thanks to their three-game win streak to start the season, Vegas has become the first expansion team in any of the four major professional leagues to start the year 3-0 since the San Diego Padres did so in 1969.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what a ride it has been so far. The Golden Knights opened their season with a come-from-behind victory on two Neal tallies. Neal was again the linchpin of the operation in their first overtime win in franchise history in their second game of the season. Vegas’ leading goal scorer took a back seat for a little while in their home opener on Tuesday, but Neal ended the game with another two tallies on the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fleury, on the other hand, has been one of the league’s best goaltenders as he’s allowed just four goals on 107 shots against through three games.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a pace that’s clearly unsustainable for the Golden Knights, who will no doubt falter days, weeks, or months down the line in a strong Western Conference. Many project the Golden Knights to fall near the basement of the league, and for beneficial reasons rather than spiteful ones. It’s a drop that will come sooner rather than later, as Neal’s scoring touch evens back to the mean and Fleury stops bailing his defense out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, what the Golden Knights are doing right now is nothing short of remarkable. They’re already the talk of the league thanks to their dramatic victories, and their plucky spirit that has made them feel like a living, breathing NHL team in record time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The toughest challenges are still ahead for Vegas, but this has been one incredible start to their first season as an NHL franchise.\n",

      "COUVA, Trinidad and Tobago — Let’s be perfectly clear: The most embarrassing failure in U.S. Soccer history was consummated on Tuesday night in a near-empty stadium in the Caribbean tropics, culminating in a soul-crushing 2-1 defeat to a last-place opponent in which the U.S. men’s national team had only needed a win or a tie to qualify for World Cup 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this miasma of futility—causing the U.S. to miss the World Cup for the first time since 1986—was only the endpoint of a long series of felonies and misdemeanors over the last 12 months in Columbus, Ohio, and in San Jose, Costa Rica; in Harrison, N.J., and in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. The dateline for the autopsy of this U.S. team may read Couva, a tiny town that no U.S. soccer fan will ever forget, but the seeds for this dark day were planted in several locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes down to it, CONCACAF is a frighteningly forgiving region for World Cup qualifying. Mexico qualified for Brazil 2014 after winning just two of 10 Hexagonal games. The U.S. was eliminated from Russia 2018 after just three victories in 10 qualifiers. The Americans started with a giant margin for error and then proceeded to whittle it down, in chunks large and small, from two opening defeats to last month’s home loss to Costa Rica to the finishing blow on Tuesday—a catastrophic capitulation to a team that had lost six straight Hexagonal games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterward, players fought back tears. One of them was defender Omar Gonzalez, who saw the hosts’ first goal bounce off his shin and into the U.S. net for an own goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s one that will haunt me forever,” he said. “I never thought I would see this day. It’s the worst day of my career … What was supposed to be a celebration is now … I don’t even know what to say. It’s terrible. I just want to say sorry to all the fans that were pulling for us, that wanted to go to Russia, that believed in us. We let down an entire nation today.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another player who was disconsolate was forward Jozy Altidore, who made little impact on the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you don’t look at yourself after this individually,” he said, “I think you’re f---ed up in the head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. captain Michael Bradley had 90 minutes by himself in doping control after the game to digest the doomsday scenario that had just played out; a U.S. loss combined with Panama and Honduras wins was the only way the Americans could be eliminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a perfect storm kind of night,” he said after emerging. “Everything that could have possibly gone wrong did, in this stadium and in two other stadiums across the region. To give away the first goal like that [on an own goal] is a killer. It comes from nothing and it ultimately gives them life, gives them energy. It means that all of the sudden they believe, that there’s something there for them. The second goal, the guy [Alvin Jones] hits a great shot that flies into the far corner … We got back to 2-1 and at that point couldn’t make a play to unlock them, couldn’t get the final pass, the final shot, the final action. You can go around in circles a million times over again. But the reality is it was all there for us, and we have nobody to blame but ourselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s right. The U.S. deserved to drop all the points it did during this miserable qualifying campaign. There were no horrible referee calls that changed results, no bad bounces that somehow rolled into the goal. Trinidad and Tobago, like Costa Rica before it, realized that this U.S. team could be beaten if you sat back, soaked up pressure and picked the right spots to move forward and threaten the goal. The U.S. proved time and again that it didn’t have the ability to break down a team defending that way. You can’t ask 19-year-old Christian Pulisic—who scored the U.S. goal on Tuesday—to do everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ashley Allen/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "“Teams certainly have shown they’re going to sit back and frustrate us,” said U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard. “So you’re probably going to need to break some teams down. Until we do that, teams won’t come out of their shell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Arena, the U.S. had appeared to recover much of its old identity—namely, being hard to play against as a unit—between March and June. But that identity mysteriously disappeared again in three of the last four qualifying games over the past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Collectively one through 11, we weren’t able to defend well enough,” said Altidore. “You can’t go and score four or five goals every game. We have to be able to be hard to play against. We weren’t hard enough to play against too many times.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the U.S. players appeared shellshocked. When the Netherlands was eliminated from the World Cup on Tuesday, the Dutch players knew it was coming, since they had to win by an unrealistic seven goals over Sweden. But the Americans fully expected to qualify for Russia on Tuesday, and at the very least they thought they’d be heading to the intercontinental playoff against Australia. Full elimination wasn’t in the picture, and their dazed looks suggested they were having trouble processing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A full reckoning will now have to take place by U.S. Soccer. Arena’s days are numbered, for one thing. He took responsibility for the failure after the game, as he should have: The home loss to Costa Rica and Tuesday’s fiasco were inexcusable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m clearly very disappointed,” he said. “We had everything there for us today … We should not be staying home from this World Cup.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But Arena wouldn’t go so far to say that major changes should take place in U.S. Soccer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s nothing wrong with what we’re doing,” he argued. “Certainly, I think if our league continues to grow it benefits the national team program. We have some good players coming up. Nothing has to change. To make any kind of crazy changes I think would be foolish. We’re building a consistent professional league. We have players playing abroad of a certain quality. There’s enough there. There’s no excuses for us to not qualify for the World Cup.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Abraham Diaz/AFP/Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "As Arena spoke, U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati sat nearby with a blank look on his face, as if he didn’t know what had hit him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Extremely disappointed,” he said. “We certainly expected to qualify throughout the process and especially after Friday night [a 4-0 win over Panama]. So it’s a huge disappointment for everybody: The players, the staff, the coaches, for the federation. It’s not good enough, obviously.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Gulati was pressed on whether wholesale changes were necessary after this debacle, he shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So wholesale changes aren’t needed if the ball that hits off the post [from Clint Dempsey] goes in?” he said. “You don’t make wholesale changes based on the ball being two inches wide or two inches in. We’ll look at everything, obviously, and all our programs, both the national team and all the development stuff. But we’ve got a lot of pieces in place that we think are very good and have been coming along. Tonight obviously wasn’t what we hoped for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet this American failure wasn’t due to one shot hitting the post. It was due to repeated fatal flaws that were exposed time and again over the last 12 months. If you can’t qualify from one of the easiest and most forgiving regional competitions on Earth, how are you going to compete at a World Cup? It remains to be seen now whether Gulati will run for reelection in February—and whether he’ll have a chance to win if he does. The drumbeat for change, real change, will ring loudly now.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, be wary of those who promise easy answers for complex problems. Too many people in the U.S. soccer community think there are lightning-bolt answers—Promotion and relegation! Send all the youngsters to Europe!—that will solve everything. They won’t. There should be an honest discussion, though, of the factors that led to this day that will live in infamy. It will take some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday night, though, everyone was still processing the shock and what had led to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We dropped too many points on too many days,” Bradley said. “We put ourselves at a disadvantage from the very beginning when we lost the first two games. When you lose the first two games and drop points on too many days, your margin for error goes. So you know you’re at the mercy of a night like this where everything possible goes against you, both here and in the two other games.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s just reality. That’s on us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then Bradley walked away, by himself, into the darkness and an uncertain future for U.S. Soccer.\n",
